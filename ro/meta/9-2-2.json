It measures the ability of the manufacturing sector to absorb surplus labour from agricultural and other traditional sectors. However, in developed countries an opposite trend is expected where emphasis has shifted to reduction in labor in manufacturing as part of cost-cutting measures, to promote more capital-intensive industries. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The characteristics of the data source impact the international comparability of the data, especially in cases where the coverage of the source is less than comprehensive (either in terms of country territory or economic activities). In the absence of a labour force survey (the preferred source of data for this indicator), some countries may use an establishment survey to derive this indicator, but these usually have a minimum establishment size cut-off point and small units which are not officially registered (whether in manufacturing or not) would thus not be included in the survey. Consequently, employment data may be underestimated. Discrepancies can also be caused by differences in the definition of employment or the working&#x2013;age population. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<h2>Computation Method:</h2>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">T</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">y</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">u</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">f</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">c</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">u</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">r</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">g</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">c</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">v</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">T</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">y</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">c</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">c</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">c</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">v</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n    <mo>&#xD7;</mo>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n  </math></p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>The ILO engages in annual consultations with Member States through the ILOSTAT questionnaire and related Statistics Reporting System (StaRS).

These models use multivariate regression and cross-validation techniques to impute missing values at the country level, which are then aggregated to produce regional and global estimates. The regional and global shares of employment in manufacturing are obtained by first adding up, across countries, the numerator and denominator of the formula that defines the manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment - outlined above. Once both magnitudes are produced at the desired level of aggregation, the ratio between the two is used to compute the share for each regional grouping and the global level.
