It moved away from a focus on reaching specific demographic targets to a focus on the needs, aspirations and rights of individual women and men. The Programme of Action asserted that everyone counts, that the true focus of development policy must be the improvement of individual lives and the measure of progress should be the extent to which we address inequalities.

Data for SDG indicator 5.6.1 may be collected through existing country-specific surveys. For existing national household surveys, it must be ascertained that the sampling design does not systematically exclude subgroups of the population that are important to SDG 5.6.1, specifically, women of reproductive age (15-49) that are currently married or in a union. Surveys that cover only certain population subgroups, such as women who speak the dominant language or women from the main ethnic group, may exclude the experiences of many women. Data on the ethnicity and religion of the survey participants should be collected whenever available. The survey should have a large sample size (usually between 5,000 and 30,000 households), be nationally representative, and be representative, at least, at one administrative level below the national level.</p>\n<p>Surveys on unrelated topics may not be good candidates for the incorporation of the SDG 5.6.1 questions. The sensitivity of the topics addressed in health surveys those examining women&#x2019;s health, makes them a feasible instrument for incorporating questions on women&#x2019;s experience of decision making in health care, use of contraceptives, and sexual relations for themselves.</p>\n<p>To generate data for SDG 5.6.1, all three questions must be included in the survey. The three questions in the Definition section provide generic questions that can be used in country-specific surveys.

UNFPA was given the lead in helping countries carry out the Programme of Action adopted by 179 governments at the Cairo Conference.

Depending on the type of contraceptive method being used, a decision by the woman &#x201C;alone&#x201D; or &#x201C;jointly with the partner&#x201D; does not always entail that the woman is empowered or has bargaining skills. Conversely, it is safe to assume that a woman that does not participate, at all, in making contraceptive choices is disempowered as far as sexual and reproductive decisions are concerned. </p>\n<p>A woman&#x2019;s ability to say no to her husband/partner if she does not want to have sexual intercourse is well aligned with the concept of sexual autonomy and women&#x2019;s empowerment.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Until recently, the indicator captured results for married and in-union women and adolescent girls of reproductive age (15&#x2013;49 years old) <u>who are using any type of contraception</u>.
