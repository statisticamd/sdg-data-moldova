Such data are crucial for improving health and reducing preventable deaths in countries.

Model</u></p>\n<p>&apos;WHO estimation of health impacts from environmental risks is based on comparative risk assessment (CRA) methods, which are used extensively in burden of disease assessments (Ezzati et al., 2002). This approach estimates the proportional reduction in disease or death that would occur if exposures were reduced to an alternative baseline level bearing a minimum risk (also referred to as theoretical minimum risk), while other conditions remain unchanged. The CRA methodology combines data on exposure, disease burden and the exposure-response relationship to estimate the burden of disease associated with that exposure (Ezzati et al., 2002). For each risk factor (unsafe water, sanitation, or hygiene), the population attributable fraction (PAF) is estimated by comparing current exposure distributions to a counterfactual distribution, for each exposure level, sex and age group:</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">F</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mrow>\n          <munderover>\n            <mo stretchy=\"false\">&#x2211;</mo>\n            <mrow>\n              <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n              <mo>=</mo>\n              <mn>1</mn>\n            </mrow>\n            <mrow>\n              <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n            </mrow>\n          </munderover>\n          <mrow>\n            <msub>\n              <mrow>\n                <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi>\n              </mrow>\n              <mrow>\n                <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n              </mrow>\n            </msub>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n            <mo>(</mo>\n            <msub>\n              <mrow>\n                <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">R</mi>\n                <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">R</mi>\n              </mrow>\n              <mrow>\n                <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n              </mrow>\n            </msub>\n            <mo>-</mo>\n            <mn>1</mn>\n            <mo>)</mo>\n          </mrow>\n        </mrow>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mrow>\n          <munderover>\n            <mo stretchy=\"false\">&#x2211;</mo>\n            <mrow>\n              <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n              <mo>=</mo>\n              <mn>1</mn>\n            </mrow>\n            <mrow>\n              <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n            </mrow>\n          </munderover>\n          <mrow>\n            <msub>\n              <mrow>\n                <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi>\n              </mrow>\n              <mrow>\n                <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n              </mrow>\n            </msub>\n            <mfenced separators=\"|\">\n              <mrow>\n                <msub>\n                  <mrow>\n                    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">R</mi>\n                    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">R</mi>\n                  </mrow>\n                  <mrow>\n                    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n                  </mrow>\n                </msub>\n                <mo>-</mo>\n                <mn>1</mn>\n              </mrow>\n            </mfenced>\n            <mo>+</mo>\n            <mn>1</mn>\n          </mrow>\n        </mrow>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n  </math></p>\n<p>Where <em>pi</em> and <em>RR<sub>i</sub></em> are the proportion of the exposed population and the relative risk at exposure level <em>i</em>, respectively, and <em>n</em> is the total number of exposure levels.
