Foreign direct investment</p>\n<p>Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a category of investment that reflects the objective of establishing a lasting interest by a resident enterprise in one economy (direct investor) in an enterprise (direct investment enterprise) that is resident in an economy other than that of the direct investor. The lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the direct investment enterprise and a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise. The direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of the voting power of an enterprise resident in one economy by an investor resident in another economy is taken as evidence of such a relationship.

Mobilised private finance (MPF) on an experimental basis</p>\n<p>Mobilised private finance (MPF) consists of private resource flows for activities in developing countries which have been mobilised by interventions of multilateral development banks (MDBs), bilateral development finance institutions, or other bilateral agencies, i.e. where a direct causal link between the official intervention and the private resources can be demonstrated. The OECD method for counting MPF is used; see <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/mobilisation.htm\">https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/mobilisation.htm</a>. MPF is a &#x201C;memorandum item&#x201D; because it would likely include and overlap with some finance that would also be found in the FDI sub-indicator. MPF data are typically collected on a commitment basis, rather than in terms of developing country receipts. This indicator excludes private flows mobilised in recipient countries themselves as they do not constitute additional resources. The indicator is included on an experimental basis, and it is recommended that it be reviewed during the 2025 review of SDG indicators.</p>\n<p>f. Private grants</p>\n<p>Private grants are here taken to mean grants for developmental purposes from private institutions outside the recipient country, excluding commercial flows and personal transactions such as remittances. They essentially comprise grants from philanthropic foundations and other non-governmental organizations.</p>\n<p>Sustainable development criteria</p>\n<p>Based on the Group&#x2019;s discussions, and building on the work of the TOSSD Task Force, the following cascading approach will be used to identify flows that can be considered as supporting sustainable development:</p>\n<p>1. Flows within the proposed indicators and sub-indicators detailed below and identified individually, such as a specific activity in provider reporting systems, should be included if they directly support either (i) at least one of the SDG targets or (ii) an objective in the recipient country&#x2019;s development plan as long as this is directed towards supporting or achieving sustainable development, with the following exceptions:</p>\n<p>a. Flows for activities where a substantial detrimental effect is anticipated on one or more of the other targets. </p>\n<p>b. Flows where the recipient country, after discussion with the custodian agency and/or the reporting provider country, objects to their characterization as supporting its sustainable development. </p>\n<p>2. Flows, or portions of flows within the proposed indicators and sub-indicators detailed below for which data are only available at the aggregate country-to-country level are also considered as supporting sustainable development, subject to the same exceptions as under 1.a and 1.b.</p>\n<p>Note that some sub-indicators may contain a mixture of activity-specific and aggregate-level flow data and therefore require assessment against 1 and 2 respectively. Also note that further specific exclusions are proposed, as detailed below, that may in some cases be considered to reinforce the focus of the proposed indicators on the sustainable development of developing countries.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>US dollar</p>","CLASS_SYSTEM__GLOBAL":"<p>TOSSD classifications are available at: <a href=\"http://www.tossd.org/methodology\">www.tossd.org/methodology</a> (See &#x201C;TOSSD code lists&#x201D;)</p>\n<p>Modalities of South-South cooperation as defined in the initial conceptual framework. </p>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<p>Existing databases established at the OECD and UNCTAD will serve as a data source.

Furthermore, it does not include private non-concessional loans; portfolio investment; export credits, whether official, officially-supported, or private; short-term flows with an original maturity of 1 year or less; or any other flows that are not within the scope of the proposed sub-indicators. These exclusions sharpen the focus of the indicator on transfers of new resources to developing countries for sustainable development purposes, while excluding commercially-motivated debt-creating flows.

Data gaps linked to providers reporting to the OECD DAC (Creditor Reporting System) but not to TOSSD have been estimated (i.e. for Czech Republic, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Germany, the IMF concessional trust funds, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the World Bank).</p>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<ul>\n  <li>Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators: Working Group on Measurement of Development Support, Finalized draft indictor proposal for SDG Target 17.3 and its reporting, (4 October 2021).</li>\n  <li>Outcome document of the sub-group on South-South cooperation, September 2021</li>\n  <li>The TOSSD Methodology, including Reporting Instructions, code lists and data collection form: <a href=\"https://www.tossd.org/methodology\">https://www.tossd.org/methodology</a> </li>\n  <li>Converged Statistical Reporting Directives for the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and the Annual DAC Questionnaire, DAC Working Party on Development Finance Statistics, 20 April 2021, available at <a href=\"https://one.oecd.org/document/DCD/DAC/STAT(2020)44/FINAL/en/pdf\">https://one.oecd.org/document/DCD/DAC/STAT(2020)44/FINAL/en/pdf</a> </li>\n  <li>Links to data<ul>\n      <li><a href=\"https://tossd.online/\">TOSSD Visualisation Tool</a> - <a href=\"https://tossd.online/\">https://tossd.online/</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-data/\">Development finance data - OECD</a> - <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-data/\">https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-data/</a></li>\n      <li>Investment statistics and trends (UNCTAD):<ul>\n          <li>https://unctadstat.unctad.org/</li>\n          <li><a href=\"https://unctadstat.unctad.org/wds/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=96740\">Beyond 20/20 WDS - Table view - Foreign direct investment: Inward and outward flows and stock, annual (unctad.org)</a> - <a href=\"https://unctadstat.unctad.org/wds/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=96740\">https://unctadstat.unctad.org/wds/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=96740</a></li>\n          <li><a href=\"https://unctad.org/topic/investment/world-investment-report\">World Investment Report | UNCTAD</a> - <a href=\"https://unctad.org/topic/investment/world-investment-report\">https://unctad.org/topic/investment/world-investment-report</a></li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Amounts mobilised from the private sector for development (OECD method for counting MPF), see <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/mobilisation.htm\">https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/mobilisation.htm</a></li>\n  <li>GUIDANCE NOTE ON THE BANK-FUND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR LOW INCOME COUNTRIES, IMF, February 2018, available at: </li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2018/02/14/pp122617guidance-note-on-lic-dsf\">https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2018/02/14/pp122617guidance-note-on-lic-dsf</a></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment - 4th Edition, available at <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/investment/fdibenchmarkdefinition.htm\">https://www.oecd.org/investment/fdibenchmarkdefinition.htm</a></li>\n  <li>UNCTAD Training Manual on Statistics for FDI and the Operations of TNCs - Volume I FDI Flows and Stocks, UNCTAD, 2009, available at: <a href=\"https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/diaeia20091_en.pdf\">https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/diaeia20091_en.pdf</a></li>\n  <li>UNCTAD Statistics Quality Assurance Framework (SQAF), see <a href=\"https://unctad.org/webflyer/statistics-quality-assurance-framework\">https://unctad.org/webflyer/statistics-quality-assurance-framework</a> </li>\n  <li>United Nations Quality Assurance Framework, see <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/dataquality/\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/dataquality/</a> </li>\n  <li>Quality Framework for OECD Statistical Activities, see <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/sdd/qualityframeworkforoecdstatisticalactivities.htm\">https://www.oecd.org/sdd/qualityframeworkforoecdstatisticalactivities.htm</a>.</li>\n</ul>","target_number":"17.3","goal_number":"17","indicator_sort_order":"17-03-01"}
