Curriculum area Counseling and personal development includes the mandatory discipline Development personal, studied 1 hour per week, in primary, secondary and high school education The reconceptualized school discipline Education for society is compulsory for students in secondary and high school education and has replaced the Civic Education discipline.</p>  <p></p>  <p>(i) Sustainable development: The framework plan for primary, secondary and high school education offers every student the opportunity to opt for optional subjects. The optional subjects represent the flexible component of the Education Framework Plan that contributes to the development of transversal skills. The priority areas also include Education for Sustainable Development, which is oriented towards the use of competences in the field of ecological education to understand and identify solutions in case of local and global problems, such as those of sustainable development, environment, green economy, energy conservation/ use of alternative energy sources/promotion of energy efficiency measures, etc. The curriculum developed in 2018 for the Science discipline in primary education also highlights the training of students' skills and the interest in actively promoting environmental values and a healthy way of life. The theme of ecological education is studied in educational institutions within the framework of compulsory classes, optional classes and extracurricular activities. The teaching staff orients the students, in school subjects related to the pre-noted field, towards the use of skills in the field of ecological education, for understanding and identifying solutions in the case of local and global problems, as well as those of sustainable development, environment, green economy, conservation energy and promoting energy efficiency measures. For the organization of optional classes, teachers have the Curriculum for the optional discipline \"Ecological Education\" for grades I-XII and the Curriculum for the optional discipline \"Chemistry and environmental exploration\" for grades X-XII (approved by the National Curriculum Council and by order ME no. 874 of September 8, 2015). At the same time, the Regional Center for the Environment for Central and Eastern Europe in collaboration with the MEC have developed didactic content on sustainable development and the application of the Green Pack set in educational institutions.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p>(ii) Human rights: The school discipline reconceptualized in 2018 Education for society is mandatory for students in secondary and high school education and has gradually replaced the discipline Civic Education. The implementation of the discipline provides for the formation in students of the values of the rule of law, the development of the necessary skills, the respect of the rights and responsibilities of citizens through the prism of studying the integrated modules with reference to Education for human rights, Education for democratic citizenship, Education for integrity, Patriotic education, Intercultural education, etc. The mandatory discipline Education for society includes the content unit Human dignity and human rights, which includes the theme: all people are equal in rights, rights in conflict, rights of the child/man, protection tools and ensuring rights, assuming responsibility. It also includes the content unit Law for All with the topics: law for all, rights and responsibilities, children in conflict with the law, breaking the law and punishment, punishment versus education, etc. The optional subjects represent the flexible component of the Education Framework Plan, which contributes to the development of transversal skills. One of the priority areas for structuring the optional subjects is Civics, which come to develop in students: Participation in civic life through permanent information, understanding of political and administrative processes; Exercising citizenship rights and obligations at local, national and international level; Involvement in projects to solve community problems; Awareness of the importance of individual decisions for local and global implications.</p>  <p></p>  <p>  (iii) Gender equality: The mandatory discipline Education for society explicitly contributes to the realization of the educational ideal by capitalizing on the European reference framework, consisting of 20 competences for a democratic culture, considered specific competences of the discipline, conventionally grouped into 4 basic components, one of them being Values, which also includes the Valuing democracy, justice, equity, equality and rule of law set. This set of values is based on the general belief that societies must function and be governed by democratic processes that respect the principles of justice, equity, equality and the rule of law. The disciplinary curriculum includes content units (cl. V): All different, all equal with the theme: human similarities and differences, stereotypes and prejudices, the right to identity and non-discrimination; (cl. VIII) regarding Diversities in the community: Aspects of diversity; Equalities, similarities and differences between people; together in diversity; Tolerance and respect for diversity; Strategies for combating discrimination, etc. The mandatory discipline Personal development is structured in five modules, some of which also include content on the gender dimension: Dimension 1. Personal identity and harmonious relationships, emphasis is placed on self-knowledge and self-acceptance; exploring and self-assessing personal resources; family as a value: responsibilities, gender roles, stereotypes; assertive, non-conflictual and non-violent communication; self-education and volunteering, etc. For Class X. Dimension 1. Personal identity and harmonious relationship includes Competency Unit: Explaining the impact of stereotypes and prejudices on interpersonal behavior and relationships, including gender with Content Units: Gender Stereotypes and Prejudices. The impact of stereotypes and prejudices on behavior and interpersonal relationships. Relationship maintenance factors. Strategies to combat stereotypes and prejudices. The family. Values, traditions, visions. Gender roles and responsibilities in the family \u2013 traditional vs modern. (Grade IX) Competence units: identifying the similarities and differences between passion and love for taking responsibility in gender relations, with content units: love, passion and responsibility in gender relations; (Class XI) Competence units Description of positive relationship models and communication within gender relations, by assuming responsibility; Content units: Forming and maintaining relationships from a gender perspective. Dimension 2. Learning unit Ensuring the quality of life, includes Content units: The priorities of a young person. Meaning of priority. Setting priorities. Priorities and quality of life. Gender priorities: myth and reality. Dimension 3. The healthy way of life learning unit includes content units with the theme: writing physiological changes during adolescence, from a gender perspective; health maintenance strategies. The influence of gender characteristics on development. Physiological peculiarities. At the same time, the \"Education for gender equity and equal opportunities\" discipline was included in the list of optional subjects for the secondary school cycle, which includes content on gender equality, etc.</p>  <p>(iv) Health education: Health promotion and disease prevention, promoting health education is one of the priority objectives of the educational system. The Ministry of Education and Research promotes Health Education through the lens of all school subjects and not separately. In the mandatory discipline Personal Development, one of the five modules is the Healthy way of life, which includes such content units as: Healthy way of life \u2013 value emphasis. Health as value. Health and life priorities. Health - element of culture. Ways of manifesting the culture of personal health. Use of the right to disease prevention and health maintenance services. The frequency of medical control/diagnosis, etc., which directly or indirectly include the theme of promoting a healthy way of life. Also, in the structure of the curriculum for the mandatory subject Biology for secondary education, the module \"Human organism and health\" was developed, through which students are guided to engage in health maintenance activities in order to form a sanogenic behavior. Thus, in grades I-XII, the promotion of a healthy way of life is carried out through the reconceptualized curriculum in the mandatory discipline \"Personal Development\" (1 hour per week), starting with the 2018-2019 academic year. Health education is also carried out through the subjects: Physical Education (in the environment, 30 hours each year), the \"Healthy Lifestyle\" module, Biology, the newly introduced module in the curriculum, \"The Human Organism and Health\" (in classes VI-IX), but also through the \"Reproductive system and human reproduction\" module (in class XI). Taking into account the cyclical nature of the educational process, in curricular and extracurricular activities regarding the healthy way of life, all students from the general primary and secondary education system were included. Within the optional classes, the Breast Education discipline. </p>","RATIONALE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","DATA_COMP":"The indicator is measured through 4 components (policies, curriculum, training  of teaching personnel and evaluation of pupils), each including a series of  criteria, which are afterwards combined so as to have a score between \u201e0\u201d and  \u201e1\u201d for each component separately.","DATA_VALIDATION":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":"","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-12","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-05-24","un_designated_tier":"3","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Education and Research","source_periodicity_1":"Once every 4 years","source_url_1":"","source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_contact_1":"","source_other_info_1":"","SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"<p>Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all</p>","SDG_SERIES_DESCR__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable</p>","CONTACT_ORGANISATION__GLOBAL":"<p>UNESCO Education Sector, Division for Peace and Sustainable Development, Section of Education for Sustainable Development (UNESCO-ED/PSD/ESD) and UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UNESCO-UIS),</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n<p>Indicator 4.7.1/12.8.1/13.3.1 measures the extent to which countries mainstream Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in their education systems.
