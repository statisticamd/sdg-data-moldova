Such type of surveys are seldom collected at the national level. For this reason, the availability of data for the indicator is altogether limited. In some countries, data can be obtained from household surveys reporting details on agricultural production. These data sources have to be considered as second-best solution, given that their sampling is focused on households and not on food production units. While in many countries there is a considerable degree of overlap between the population of food producers and households, this is still a partial overlap, which can undermine the accuracy of the computation.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Computation Method:</strong></p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">S</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">D</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">G</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mn>2</mn>\n    <mo>.</mo>\n    <mn>3</mn>\n    <mo>.</mo>\n    <mn>1</mn>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <msubsup>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>I</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>2</mn>\n        <mo>.</mo>\n        <mn>3</mn>\n        <mo>.</mo>\n        <mn>1</mn>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msubsup>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mrow>\n          <munderover>\n            <mo stretchy=\"false\">&#x2211;</mo>\n            <mrow>\n              <mi>j</mi>\n              <mo>=</mo>\n              <mn>1</mn>\n            </mrow>\n            <mrow>\n              <mi>n</mi>\n            </mrow>\n          </munderover>\n          <mrow>\n            <mo>(</mo>\n            <mfrac>\n              <mrow>\n                <mrow>\n                  <munder>\n                    <mo stretchy=\"false\">&#x2211;</mo>\n                    <mrow>\n                      <mi>i</mi>\n                    </mrow>\n                  </munder>\n                  <mrow>\n                    <msubsup>\n                      <mrow>\n                        <mi>V</mi>\n                      </mrow>\n                      <mrow>\n                        <mi>i</mi>\n                        <mi>j</mi>\n                      </mrow>\n                      <mrow>\n                        <mi>t</mi>\n                      </mrow>\n                    </msubsup>\n                    <msubsup>\n                      <mrow>\n                        <mi>p</mi>\n                      </mrow>\n                      <mrow>\n                        <mi>i</mi>\n                        <mi>j</mi>\n                      </mrow>\n                      <mrow>\n                        <mi>t</mi>\n                      </mrow>\n                    </msubsup>\n                  </mrow>\n                </mrow>\n              </mrow>\n              <mrow>\n                <msubsup>\n                  <mrow>\n                    <mi>L</mi>\n                    <mi>d</mi>\n                  </mrow>\n                  <mrow>\n                    <mi>j</mi>\n                  </mrow>\n                  <mrow>\n                    <mi>t</mi>\n                  </mrow>\n                </msubsup>\n              </mrow>\n            </mfrac>\n            <mo>)</mo>\n          </mrow>\n        </mrow>\n      </mrow>\n      <mo>/</mo>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mrow>\n  </math></p>\n<p>where: </p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msubsup>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>V</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>j</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msubsup>\n  </math> is the physical volume of agricultural product i sold by the small-scale food producer j during year t; </p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msubsup>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>p</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>j</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msubsup>\n  </math> is the constant sale price received by the small-scale food producer j for the agricultural product i during same year t; </p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msubsup>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>L</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>j</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msubsup>\n  </math> is the number of labour days utilized by the small-scale food producer j during year t; </p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n  </math>is the number of small-scale food producers. </p>\n<p>As the indicator is referred to a set of production units &#x2013; those of a small scale &#x2014; the denominator needs to summarize information on the entire production undertaken in each unit. This requires that volumes of production are reported in a common numeraire, given that it is impossible to sum up physical units. The most convenient numeraire for aggregating products in the numerator is a vector of constant prices. When measured at different points in time, as required by the monitoring of the SDG indicators, changes in constant values represent aggregated volume changes. </p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>FAO is responsible to check the syntaxes used in the computation of the indicator as well as the questions.</p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>The productivity of small-scale food producers per labour day in the dataset is in local currency units (LCU). For each country and year, the LCU labour value of production has to be converted into PPP 2017 USD. The process first consists on accounting for inflation in the currency, for which the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of each country is used; once deflated, it is converted into PPP 2017 USD, which allows for a homogenous standard of the indicator. SDG 2.3 not only focuses on small-scale farmers, but also on women and people with indigenous status. The indicator (which is at the household level) is then calculated disaggregated by sex of the household head or producer (depending on whether a household or an agricultural survey was used), that is, whether the household head or producer is female or male headed.</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<ul>\n  <li><strong>At country level</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Variables employed in the computation are subject to outlier detection, through Median Absolute Deviations and other approaches, on a case by case basis. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>At regional and global levels</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>No imputation of data is made at the regional and global level. </p>","REG_AGG__GLOBAL":"<p>No regional or global aggregates can be computed, given the limited availability of data. </p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>Countries can rely on the methodology paper available at <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/ca3043en/ca3043en.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/ca3043en/ca3043en.pdf</a> and the eLearning available at <a href=\"https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=483\">https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=483</a> .</p>","QUALITY_MGMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>Logical and arithmetic control of reporting data is carried out.</p>","QUALITY_ASSURE__GLOBAL":"<p>The microdata of surveys utilized in the computation are publicly available, hence their quality rests with the producers.
