  <p> The indicator does not represent the density or the penetration of mobile  telephony services.</p> 
  <p>  The indicator is based on the place where the  population resides and not the place where they work or go to school, etc.  When there is a number of operators offering this service, the maximum number  of covered population should be reported. ANRCETI collects data from 3  operators, Orange, Moldtelecom, Moldcell. </p>
