  Municipal waste - household waste and similar waste from commercial,  industrial and administrative activities, mentioned in item 20 of the List of  wastes, approved by the Government (Law on waste no. 209/2016, GD no. 99/2018,  for the approval of the Waste List). The degree of compliance of the landfill  can be assessed using qualitative criteria that include: 1) the degree of  control of waste reception and general management of the landfill site; 2) the  degree of control of the waste over the treatment and disposal and 3) the  degree of monitoring and verification of the control over the environment. A  score of at least 10 of each criterion is the threshold required to be  considered "appropriate final treatment and elimination".

  <p> 1. To calculate the global  indicator, denominator - total generated municipal waste is calculated from  the sum of municipal waste regularly collected and the quantity of uncollected  waste (which is not estimated/calculated in Moldova)</p> 
  <p> 2. The control level  according to the global methodology cannot be assessed, as well as to what  extent the treatment and final storage of waste is "adequate". </p>
