  <p> The Index of Species included in the Red Book is calculated at a given moment  through several steps: 1) first, multiplying the number of species from each  category of the list with a risk degree (varying from 1 for those "under the  extinction risk” to 5 for those "extinct” or "extinct in the wild”) ; 2)  summing up the obtained values; 3) the obtained result is divided to the  maximum score of threat, which represents the total number of species  multiplied by weight attributed to the category of "extinct species”; 4). this  final value is subsided from 1 to obtain the value of the Red List Index.</p> 
  <p>   The formula for calculating the indicator needs:</p> 
  <p>  1) for exactly the same  set of species to be included in all periods of time</p> 
  <p>  2) the only  changes of categories of the Red List to be the ones which result from genuine  improvement of deterioration of the status (meaning, excluding the changes  resulted from knowledge improvement or taxonomy review)</p> 
  <p>  3) species  with missing data are excluded. </p>

  <p> RLIt = 1 - [(Ss Wc (t, s) / (WEX * N)]</p> 
  <p>  where:</p> 
  <p>  Wc (t, s) – risk  degree for category (c) at the moment (t) for species (the degree of   "critically endangered” = 4, "endangered” = 3, "vulnerable” = 2,  "extinction  risk”= 1, ”the lowest risk”= 0. The "critically endangered" species are  determined as 'possibly extinct' or 'possibly extinct in the wild' have a  degree – 5 ; </p> 
  <p>  WEX = 5, the degree attributed to "extinct species” or  "extinct in the wild”; and N is the total number of assessed species, except  for those assessed as missing data in the current period, and those considered  to be „extinct” in the year when the set of species was assessed for the first  time. </p>
