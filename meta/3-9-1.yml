  Air pollution is one of the highest risks for health. According to WHO data,  the combined effects of ambient air pollution (of air in indoor and outdoor  households area) determines over 7 million premature deaths on annual basis.  The majority of deaths occur as a cause of strokes, heart diseases, chronic  obstructive lung diseases, lung cancer and acute respiratory diseases. The  biggest burden is supported by populations of countries with small and medium  revenues.
