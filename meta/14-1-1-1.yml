  Eutrophication of the increase of biological productivity, of plankton algae  biomass in waterbeds. Eutrophication of waterbeds is favoured by such factors  as: presence of some compounds originating from wastewater, nutrient species  with nitrogen and phosphorus, biodegradable organic compounds (light and  temperature). Chemical indices of eutrophication are: 1) production of  biomass, mg/l; 2) content in dissolved oxygen, mg/l; 3) content of nitrogen  and phosphorus; 4) ratio between the chemical consumption of oxygen (CCOMn)  and concentration in dissolved oxygen; 5) ratio of mineral nitrogen and total  phosphorus = 10. Lakes represent a high risk of eutrophication, as compared  with watercourses.

  Global indicator refers to the eutrophication level and coast water pollution,  while the national one - as there is no maritime water - refers to the level  of eutrophication of surface water bodies from the territory of the country
