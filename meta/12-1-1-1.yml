  <p> Green Economy is the economic development contributing to increasing people's  wellbeing and increasing social fairness, while reducing significantly the  negative impact on environment.</p> 
  <p>  Sustainable Production and Consumption  (SPC) - use of services and products related to them, which meet the basic  needs and improve the quality of life, minimising the use of natural resources  and toxic materials, as well as of waste and pollutants' emission during the  life cycle of the service or product, so as not to endanger the consumption  needs of the next generations </p> 
  <p>  Policy tools for sustainable production  and consumption: the policy tools refer to methodologies, measures or  interventions, which are used for achieving these objectives. In case of SPC,  such tools are developed and applied so as to reduce the environmental impact  of consumption and production models, for the purpose of generating economic  and/or social benefits. </p>
