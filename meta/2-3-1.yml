  <p>Target 2.3: By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food  producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers,  pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land,  other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets  and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment</p>

  <p> Volume of agricultural production per labour unit in  agricultural/livestock/forestry enterprises </p> 
  <p>  FAO suggest defining the small producers of food supply as producers that:</p> 
  <p>  1) operate with a size of land plots that fits the first two quintiles (under 40%) from the cumulated  distribution of the size of land plots at the national level (measured in  hectares); and</p> 
  <p>  2) operate with a number of animals which fits the first  two quintiles (under 40%) of the cumulated distribution of the number of animals per production unit at the national level (measured in livestock  units); and</p> 
  <p>  3) obtain an annual economic revenue from agricultural  activities which fits the first two quintiles (under 40%) out of the cumulated  distribution of economic revenues from agricultural activities per production  unit at the national level (measured in purchasing power parity in USD), which  does not exceed the amount of 34,387 USD at PPP .</p> 
  <p>  As the indicator refers  to a set of production units - the small scale ones - the denominator should  include the information about the entire production undertaken in every unit.  Hence it is necessary for the production volumes to be reported in a common  number, taking into account that it is impossible to refer to physical units.  The most convenient number for aggregating the products from the denominator  is a vector of constant prices. When measured at different moments in time, as  it is requested for monitoring the SDG indicators, the change of constant  values represents change in aggregated volume. </p>
