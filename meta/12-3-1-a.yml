  <p> FAO suggests defining the food losses to be measured within the  SDG 12.3.1 (a) indicator, as follows: loss of food products represents all the  quantities of plant and animal edible goods, which directly or indirectly,  derive completely from post-harvest production / slaughtered production  /  supply chain, being thrown, incinerated or other, and do not re-enter any  other use (such as food for animals, industrial use, etc.), up to and  excluding the level of retail sale. Hence, all the losses are included that  occur during the storage, transportation and processing, as well as imported  quantities. The losses include the goods in general together with their  inedible parts.</p> 
  <p>The food loss index is calculated as a ratio between the food loss percentage in the current year and the food loss percentage in the baseline  year. </p>
