  <p> The degree of integrated water resources management (IWRM) implementation  calculated as a share (%) from 0 (implementation did not yet start) up to 100  (completely implemented), is measured currently in different stages of  development and implementation of the integrated water resources management.  According to the international definition, IWRM represents a process that  promotes development and coordinated management of water, land plots and  related resources, to maximize economic and social wellbeing in a fair way,  without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems.</p> 
  <p>  The IWRM  concept is measured under 4 main components : </p> 
  <p>  1. Favourable environment:  includes policies, laws, plans and strategies which create a  „permissive/favourable environment” for IWRM.</p> 
  <p>  2. Institutions: include  the duties and roles of political, social, economic and administrative  institutions which contribute to supporting IWRM implementation.</p> 
  <p>  3.  Management tools: tools and actions allowing the decision makers and users to  make rational and informed choices among the alternative actions.</p> 
  <p>  4.  Financing. Budgeting and financing are available and used for developing and  managing water resources from different sources. </p>

  <p> 1) The indicator is calculated based on the results of a questionnaire  containing 32 questions divided into four basic components described below in  definitions.</p> 
  <p>  2) Every question receives a score from 0 to 100, in steps  by 10, based on the following 6 main categories:</p> 
  <p>  • Very low (0)</p> 
  <p>  •  Low (20)</p> 
  <p>  • Medium-low (40)</p> 
  <p>  • Medium-high (60)</p> 
  <p>  • High (80)</p> 
  <p>   • Very high (100)</p> 
  <p>  This guiding is applied for every threshold and for  every question, to provide objective and comparable results.</p> 
  <p>  3) The  un-weighted average of the scores to questions in each of the four components  is calculated so as to obtain a score from 0 to 100 for each component.</p> 
  <p>   4) The components' scores are mediate (without weighting) to obtain a score of  the indicator, expressed in percentage from 0 to 100. </p>
