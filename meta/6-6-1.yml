  <p>Indicator 6.6.1: Surface change dynamics of water-related ecosystems (indicators on the spatial extent of water-related ecosystems, water quality of lakes and artificial water bodies, the amount (discharge) of water in rivers and estuaries, the quality of water-related ecosystems, the amount of groundwater in aquifers)</p>

  <p> The indicator includes five categories: 1) wetlands with vegetation, 2) rivers  and creeks, 3) lakes, 4) aquifer  5) artificial water bodies. The indicator is  divided in 5 sub-indicators for capturing different sources of data and  methodologies, which are necessary for monitoring the components of the  indicator. The data sources derive from a combination of soils samples and  observations regarding the soil. Depending on the type of ecosystem and type  of measured degree, the methodology for collecting data may differ a lot. The  5 sub-indicators are calculated separately according to 5 different  methodologies: Sub-indicator 1: Spatial extension of water-related ecosystems;  Sub-indicator 2: Quality of lakes and artificial water bodies; Sub-indicator  3: Quantity (discharge) of water in rivers and creeks; Sub-indicator 4:  Quality of water-related ecosystems; Sub-indicator 5: Quantity of underground  water from aquifers.</p> 
  <p>  Sub-indicators 1 and 2: All the data available at  the global level, generated for these sub-indicators, are shared with  countries for validation. These geospatial data will be generated annually at  the national, subnational and water levels. While these data are generated  annually, the measurement for verifying the changes needs to be carried out  once per 5 years. The annual validated data will be used by specialised  agencies to generate percentage changes on behalf of the countries. </p> 
  <p>   Sub-indicators 3, 4 and 5: All the data collected in countries for these  sub-indicators will be sent to specialised agencies for verification and  control for quality assurance, in line with the minimum criteria of the  methodology. This analysis process will be facilitated through communication  via email through the global assistance service. After analysis of annual  „raw” data, the calculation of percentage changes will be finished and  validated between the specialised agencies and the national representative. </p>
