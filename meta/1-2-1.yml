  Monitoring national poverty is important for country-specific development agendas. National poverty lines are used to make more accurate estimates of poverty consistent with the country specific economic and social circumstances, and are not intended for international comparisons of poverty rates.

  <p> The absolute poverty rate represents the share of population that lives below the nationally established poverty line. </p> 
  <p> The absolute poverty rate represents the amount of monthly expenditures for a set of food products, non-food goods and services considered as minimum necessary amount of a household so as to ensure a decent living. </p> 
  <p> The absolute poverty rate was established in 2006 by the National Bureau of Statistics according to the methodology (developed jointly by NBS and Ministry of Economy), which implies the annual recalculation of the poverty rate based on the Consumption Price Index. In 2016 the methodology for estimating the absolute poverty indicators was reviewed and the absolute poverty rate was recalculated.</p> 
  <p> In the RM the poverty rate is established only at the national level (but not at the urban or rural levels). Since 2014, the poverty rate is calculated according to the new methodology, approved via the National Bureau of Statistics Order No.56 dated 24 August 2018. </p>
