  <p> Indicator a) measures the incidence of persons with ownership or other  property rights over agricultural land (in total agricultural population),  disaggregated by sex. </p> 
  <p>  Agricultural land - according to the WCA 2020  definition, is a land field covered with the following classes of land use:  Arable land (temporary crops + temporary pastures and grassland + temporary  abandoned ), land fields with permanent crops, land fields under permanent  pastures and grassland.</p> 
  <p>  Although the definition is not final, it is  recommended to consider as agricultural population (or from agriculture) the  adult persons living in farms in which at least one member of the household is  involved, mainly in the agricultural activity (agricultural holdings and/or  animals' growing) over the last 12 months, regardless of the final aim of  production (either for income generation, or for own consumption) and  employment status. Three conditions (proxies) will be considered for defining  the rights over agricultural land:  person 1) has legal document on the name  of the person (where the person is mentioned as "owner" or "holder"); 2) has  the right to sell the land; 3) is entitled to transfer the land in succession  (to another person) - will be considered if meeting at least one of the  conditions. </p>
