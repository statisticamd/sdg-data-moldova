  <p> The numerator of the indicator is composed of two parts: identified and  unidentified victims of THB. There are no data regarding the unidentified  victims, and they work at the global level on a methodology for estimation.  </p> 
  <p>  Some methods were already identified, but additional tests are necessary  to develop an enhanced and coordinated approach. The method for estimating the  unidentified victims of THB should allow assessing the characteristics of  victims (sex and age) and of the exploitation forms they were exposed to. </p>
