  <p> Prevalence of tobacco consumption is estimated by WHO based on population  surveys carried out at the national level, by taking over the data from the  web pages or receiving the databases from the specialised institutions in the  country.</p> 
  <p>  The estimates made by WHO for prevalence are (i) standardized  based on the age so as to improve the international comparability and (ii) are  calculated through different methods.</p> 
  <p>  The global metadata recommend more  sources for calculating this indicator. The most recent data sources available  for the RM:</p> 
  <p>  1. prevalence of smoking in adults  - through [the STEPS/2013  study](https://extranet.who.int/ncdsmicrodata/index.php/catalog/230/study-description) - include the tobacco smokers aged 18-69  years old. </p> 
  <p>   2. Prevalence of smoking in adults  - through [the STEPS/2021  study]      https://www.who.int/europe/publications/i/item/WHO-EURO-2022-6785-46551-67555 -  include the tobacco smokers aged 18-69  years old. </p>
