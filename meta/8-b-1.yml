  <p> A “developed national strategy” – an officially adopted (by the responsible government entity or authority) document that articulates a set of measures and provisions aimed at promoting youth employment within a defined timeframe.</p> 
  <p>It explicitly mentions youth as a target. It may exist on its own or as part of a wider employment or development strategy.</p> 
  <p> “Set of measures” – a mix of policy measures that includes economic and/or fiscal policies which promote youth employment, labour market policies targeting young people, policies and programmes to enhance youth employability, to promote youth entrepreneurship, and/or to protect youth rights at work.</p>

  The purpose of SDG indicator 8.b.1 is to provide an indication of the progress of countries in addressing youth employment issues. In this respect, it is assumed that having officially adopted what can be recognised as a structured strategy for youth employment would mean larger attention given by a country to youth labour market challenges, compared to countries with no strategy. In fact, the development of such a strategy usually entails broad participation of and consultation/coordination among different stakeholders.
