  <p> The 10 Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics adopted by the UN  Statistical Commission during the plenary session on April 11-15, 1994  are:</p> 
  <p>  Principle 1: Official  statistics  provide  an  indispensable   element  in  the  information  system  of  a  democratic  society,  serving   the  Government,  the economy and the public with data about the economic,  demographic, social and environmental situation. To this end, official  statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and made  available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honour  citizensâ€™ entitlement to public information. </p> 
  <p>  Principle 2. To retain  trust in official statistics, the statistical agencies need to decide  according to strictly professional considerations, including scientific   principles  and  professional  ethics,  on  the  methods  and  procedures   for  the  collection,  processing,  storage  and  presentation of statistical  data.</p> 
  <p>  Principle 3. To  facilitate  a  correct  interpretation  of  the   data,  the  statistical  agencies are to present information according to  scientific standards on the sources, methods and procedures of the  statistics.</p> 
  <p>  Principle 4. The  statistical  agencies  are  entitled  to   comment  on  erroneous  interpretation and misuse of statistics.</p> 
  <p>   Principle 5. Data  for  statistical  purposes  may  be  drawn  from  all   types  of  sources,  be  they  statistical  surveys  or  administrative   records.  Statistical agencies are to choose the source with regard to  quality, timeliness, costs and the burden on respondents.</p> 
  <p>  Principle 6.  Individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical  compilation,  whether  they  refer  to  natural  or  legal  persons,  are  to   be  strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes.</p> 
  <p>   Principle 7. The  laws,  regulations  and  measures  under  which  the   statistical  systems operate are to be made public.</p> 
  <p>  Principle 8.  Coordination among statistical agencies within countries is essential to  achieve consistency and efficiency in the statistical system.</p> 
  <p>  Principle  9. The  use  by  statistical  agencies  in  each  country  of  international   concepts,  classifications  and  methods  promotes  the  consistency  and  efficiency of statistical systems at all official levels.</p> 
  <p>  Principle 10.  Bilateral  and  multilateral  cooperation  in  statistics  contributes  to   the improvement of systems of official statistics in all countries. </p>
