  <p> Category of small agricultural producers includes households, farms with plots of land up to 10 ha.                                                                                                                                  Agricultural production is determined as the sum of crop and animal production.</p> 
  <p>Volume of crop production constitutes the value of production (global harvest of crops).</p> 
  <p>Volume of animal production is determined by the sizes of the live weight of the sow obtained and the increase of young animals raised in the course of a year, the weight gain of mature animals, as well as the amount of milk, wool, eggs and other animal products </p>
