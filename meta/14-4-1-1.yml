  <p>Target 14.4: By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal,  unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and  implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in  the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum  sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics</p>

SDG_INDICATOR_INFO__GLOBAL: >-
  The indicator Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels  measures the sustainability of the world's marine capture fisheries by their abundance. A fish stock of which abundance is at or greater than the level,  that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as  biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY  level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable.
