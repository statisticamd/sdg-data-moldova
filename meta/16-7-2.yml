  This indicator is based on surveys and measures the level of self-assessment  of "external efficiency of policies”, meaning the extent to which the  population considers that politicians and/or political institutions will  listen to and will act considering the opinions of ordinary citizens. To  tackle both dimensions of this indicator, two questions are used within the  survey/stud. The first question measures the extent to which people believe  that they really can express their opinion about what the Government does  (inclusive participation in decision-making), and the second question measures  the extent to which people feel that the political system allows them to have  an influence on policies (focusing on responsive decision-making).

  <p> The indicator is calculated based on the answers of survey respondents for two  questions that tackle two distinct dimensions, such as inclusive participation  in decision-making and taking responsive decisions by the Government:</p> 
  <p>  1)  To what extent do you consider that the policy system in the Republic of  Moldova allows the persons like you to express themselves about the  Government's actions? </p> 
  <p>  2) To what extent do you consider that the policy  system in the Republic of Moldova allows the persons like you to have an  influence on policies?</p> 
  <p>  The answers are: At all, Very unlikely, A little,  Very likely, A lot, Refuse, Do not know, Non-response. </p>
