  <p> Definition: Red Book - an official document which includes the list of species  of plants and animals which are extinct, critically endangered, endangered,  vulnerable, rare and undetermined on the territory of the Republic of Moldova,  general information regarding the status, condition, areal, as well as their  protection methods and their spreading (art. 4 of the Law No. 325 of  15.12.2005 on the Red Book of the Republic of Moldova).</p> 
  <p>  Extinct species -  species which were not found for the last 30 years, after repeated research,  in the established places, as well as in other known and similar places;</p> 
  <p>   Critically endangered species - species threatened with disappearance in the  near future in their natural habitats;</p> 
  <p>  Endangered species - species  threatened with extinction, and its survival is not likely if the cause  factors continue to influence its status;</p> 
  <p>  Vulnerable species - species  which is considered that in near future will switch to the endangered species,  if the cause factors will continue to influence its status;</p> 
  <p>  Rare species  - species which presently is not facing extinction, but which is under the  risk because of reduced areal;</p> 
  <p>  Undetermined species - species which  belong to one of the rare categories, but for which there is no sufficient  information so as to clarify exactly the category it belongs to;</p> 
  <p>  Endemic  species - species spread in the wild but only in a certain region;</p> 
  <p>  Relict  species - isolated species, due to geographical changes, on a restricted area  from its old areal </p>
