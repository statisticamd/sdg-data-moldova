  The indicator is defined as the installed capacity of power plants that generate electricity from renewable energy sources divided by the total population of a country. Capacity is defined as the net maximum electrical capacity installed at the year-end and renewable energy sources are as defined in the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

  <p> Electricity capacity is defined in the International Recommendations for Energy Statistics or IRES (UN, 2018) as the maximum active power that can be supplied continuously (i.e., throughout a prolonged period in a day with the whole plant running) at the point of outlet (i.e., after taking the power supplies for the station auxiliaries and allowing for the losses in those transformers considered integral to the station). This assumes no restriction of interconnection to the network. It does not include overload capacity that can only be sustained for a short period of time (e.g., internal combustion engines momentarily running above their rated capacity).</p> 
  <p>The IRENA defines renewable energy to include energy from the following sources: hydropower, marine energy (ocean, tidal and wave energy), wind energy, solar energy (photovoltaic and thermal energy), bioenergy and geothermal energy. </p>
