  Height for age is an index of the linear growing, and a smaller height for the  respective age is considered to be stunting. Stunting in children reflects a chronic nutritional deficiency and result in insufficient adequate dietary  input for a long period of time, of recurrent or chronic disease, as well as  of poor social-economic conditions. The indicator is measured according to the WHO Standards for Child Growth.
