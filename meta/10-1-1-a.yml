  Growth rates are calculated as annualized average growth rates over a roughly five-year period. Since many countries do not conduct surveys on a precise five-year schedule, the following rules guide selection of the survey years used to calculate the growth rates in the 2022 update: the final year of the growth period (T1) is the most recent year of a survey but no earlier than 2017, and the initial year (T0) is as close to T1 – 5 as possible, within a two-year band. Thus the gap between initial and final survey years ranges from three to seven years. If two surveys are equidistant from T1 – 5, other things being equal, the more recent survey year is selected as T0. The comparability of welfare aggregates (income or consumption) for the years chosen for T0 and T1 is assessed for every country. If comparability across the two surveys is a major concern, the selection criteria are re-applied to select the next best survey year.

  <p> For calculating the indicator: </p> 
  <p>1. The average consumption expenditures are estimated per 1 person in the country population for the years T0 and T1; </p> 
  <p>2. The annual growth rate is calculated for the consumption expenditures between these years according to the formula [[(Mean in T1) / (Mean in T0) ^ (1 / (T1-T0))] - 1] * 100. </p>
