  The indicator aims to compare the proportion of different demographic groups  (depending on aged and sex) represented in the Parliament with the proportion  of these groups in the national population with the right to vote. The right  to elect and to be elected belongs to the citizens of the Republic of Moldova  who have, including on the day of elections, the age of 18 years old, except  for those deprived of this right as established by law (art. 11; 12 of the  Electoral Code no. 1381/1997).

  <p> For single-chamber parliaments, just like the one in the Republic of Moldova,  the indicator is measured through 4 sub-indicators (1 for the young population  and 3 for women), of which 2 are calculated as rates and 2 are presented as  absolute numbers: </p> 
  <p>  1) Rate 1 = Proportion of members in the Parliament  aged 45 years old out of the proportion of population aged 45 years old and  lower with the right to vote (18 years old +) *100.</p> 
  <p>  where:</p> 
  <p>   Numerator: Number of MPs aged 45 years old and lower out of total number of  MPs. </p> 
  <p>  Denominator: Subtraction from the total number of the country  population with the right to vote (18 years old +) of the total number of  population up to the eligibility age.</p> 
  <p>  2) Rate 2 = Proportion of women /  men in the Parliament out of the proportion of women / men in total population  with the right to vote (18 years old +)</p> 
  <p>  where:</p> 
  <p>  Numerator: Number of  women MPs / men MPs in the Parliament out of the total number of MPs in the  Parliament *100</p> 
  <p>  Denominator: Proportion of women/men with the right to  vote (aged 18 years old +) out of the total number of population up to the  eligibility age.</p> 
  <p>  3) President of the Parliament: is not calculated, as  there is only one President in the Parliament, being registered only his/her  individual characteristics, meaning: age group and sex.</p> 
  <p>  4) Chairs of  parliamentary standing committees (Public Administration Committee;  Agriculture and Food Industry Committee; Culture, Education, Research, Youth,  Sport, and Mass-media Committee; Public Finance Control Committee; Human  Rights and Interethnic Relations Committee; Economy, Budget and Finance  Committee; Legal, Appointments and Immunities Committee; Environment and  Regional Development Committee; Foreign Policy and European Integration  Committee; Social Protection, Health and Family Committee, and National  Security, Defence and Public Order Committee): not calculated, as data are  collected for the 11 chairs of the committees. Only their individual  characteristics are registered, meaning: age group and sex. </p>

  Unlike the global indicator, whose sub-indicator 3 is calculated as an  absolute number of chairs of 5 standing committees (Foreign Affairs, Defence,  Finance, Human Rights and Gender Equality), the national indicator is  calculated as an absolute number of 11 chairs of standing parliamentary  committees established in the X legislature.
