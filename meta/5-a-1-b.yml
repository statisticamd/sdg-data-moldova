  <p> Indicator b) focuses on gender parity and measures the extent to which women are disadvantaged in relation to the ownership right or other property rights over agricultural land.</p> 
  <p>   Agricultural land - according to the WCA 2020 definition, is a land field covered with the following classes of land use: Arable land (temporary crops + temporary pastures and grassland + temporary abandoned ), land fields with permanent crops, land fields under permanent pastures and grassland.</p> 
  <p>   Although the definition is not final, it is recommended to consider as agricultural population (or from agriculture) the adult persons living in farms in which at least one member of the household is involved, mainly in the agricultural activity (agricultural holdings and/or animals' growing) over the last 12 months, regardless of the final aim of production (either for income generation, or for own consumption) and employment status. Three conditions (proxies) will be considered for defining the rights over agricultural land:  person 1) has legal document on the name of the person (where the person is mentioned as "owner" or "holder"); 2) has the right to sell the land; 3) is entitled to transfer the land in succession (to another person) - will be considered if meeting at least one of the conditions. </p>
