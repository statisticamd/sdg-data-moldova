  <p> Security related to the tenure right: the perception regarding the security of  tenure rights to land refers to the perception of a person about the  probability of losing involuntarily a land plot in possession or to lose the  capacity to use it. Although it would seem that the persons who do not hold  any documents regarding the tenure rights to land may be frequently perceived  as at risk, or that those who hold such documents are more protected, actually  there might be situations in which even the holding of such documents cannot  guarantee the security for tenure rights. On the contrary, even without legal  documents, persons may feel themselves protected against deprivation or  dispossession. Hence, the observation and analysis of such situations will  allow better understanding the land security, based on the specific context of  the country. </p> 
  <p>  For the purpose of producing the indicator, it is suggested  to define the perceptions regarding the security of tenure rights to land if:  (i) the right holder (respondent) does not state any fear regarding the  involuntary loss of the land plot in the following five years because of, for  instance, any threats/dangers within the family, community or of external  nature and (ii) the right holder states that he/she has the right to transfer  the land plot as inheritance. </p>
