  Gender pay gap (GPG) (in unadjusted form) represents the share of the difference between the  average gross monthly earnings of men (ME) and women (WE) in the average gross  hourly salary earnings of men expressed as percentage. The indicator has been defined as unadjusted, because it gives an overall picture of gender inequalities in terms of pay and measures a concept which is broader than the concept of equal pay for equal work. The average gross  monthly earnings is determined by reporting the gross calculated amounts for  employees in the reporting year (regardless of the period of time for which  these are due) to the average number of employees and number of months in the  year.
