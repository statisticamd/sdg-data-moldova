  <p> This indicator measures the degree in which the result of cumulated budgetary  expenditures reflects the initially approved amount, as it was defined in the  documentation on the state budget and fiscal reports. The coverage is the  consolidated state budget and the covered time period is the last three  finished fiscal years. The indicator attempts to reflect the reliability of  the state budget. The cumulated expenditures include the real expenditures  which cover the expenditures incurred as a result of some unplanned or  exceptional events  - for instance, armed conflicts or natural disasters.  Expenditures financed through unexpected revenues, including through  privatisation, should be included and recorded in fiscal tables and in  narrative support. Expenditures financed externally through loans or  subventions should be included, if they are covered by the budget, together  with the emergency vote and loan interest rates. Expenditures allocated to  waiting accounts are not included in total. Nevertheless, if the amounts are  held in suspension accounts at the end of every year, which could affect the  scores if included in the calculation, they can be included. In such cases,  the reasons for inclusion should be clearly indicated.</p> 
  <p>  Actual  expenditures may deviate from the initially approved budget due to reasons  independent from accuracy of previsions - for instance, as a result of a major  macro-economic shock. The calibration of this indicator supports an unusual or  "exceeded" year and focuses on deviations from previsions, which appear on two  out of the three years which are subject to evaluation. </p>

  <p> The methodology for calculating this indicator is presented within an extended  table (called „Calculation Sheet for PFM Performance Indicators PI-1 and PI-2  (i)” ) on [the PEFA web  page](http://www.pefa.org/sites/default/files/En-PI-1%20%26%20PI-2%20Exp%20calculation-Jan%202015.xls).  As well, this is described in detail in the second part of the document  ["Public Finance Management Evaluation  Framework”](https://pefa.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/PEFA%20Framework_English_Web_Dec18_Second%20Edition.pdf).</p> 
  <p>   The essence of the indicator is the score. The country is assessed separately  on a ordinal scale in four points: A, B, C or D, in line with exact  criteria:</p> 
  <p>  (A) Total expenditures varied from 95% to 105% of the total  budgetary expenditures approved for at least two of the last three years.</p> 
  <p>   (B) Total expenditures varied from 90% to 110% of the total budgetary  expenditures approved for at least two of the last three years.</p> 
  <p>  (C)  Cumulative expenditures varied from 85% to 115% of total budgetary  expenditures approved for at least two of the last three years.</p> 
  <p>  (D)  Productivity is lower than the one which is necessary for C degree. </p>
