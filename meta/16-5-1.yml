  <p> The global indicator refers to the respondent's individual experience, who is  selected randomly from the household members, while the experience of other  members in relation to offering bribe is not included. </p> 
  <p>  Although the  national indicator is similar to the global one, there are some differences:  1) the data of the study from 2015 take into consideration the individual  experience of bribe giving of the respondent and of the household members that  he/she is a part of; 2) the data of the study from 2018 take into  consideration the individual experience of bribe-giving of the respondents  selected randomly, active economic agents and public agents from public  administration of Chisinau municipality. </p>
