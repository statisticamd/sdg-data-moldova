  <p> The indicator is calculated using three variables with corresponding weight  for the final calculation. There were no changes in the calculations and no  mixed sources were used.</p> 
  <p>  Variable 1: Existence of laws, regulations,  policies, plans or strategies drafted specially for or meant for the  small-scale fishing sector.</p> 
  <p>  Variable 2: Implementation of specific  initiatives for implementing the SSF Guideline </p> 
  <p>  Option 3: Existence of  some mechanisms which would allow the small-scale fishers and workers from the  fishing sector to participate in decision-taking processes </p> 
  <p>  The results  are assessed based on the relevant answers from the three questions in the  Questionnaire for responsible fishing (CCRF). These questions are transformed  into weighted variables for calculating the scores of the country. The  objective was to have a positive answer („yes”) to all the sub-variables,  resulting in 1 point. </p>
