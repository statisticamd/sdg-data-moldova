  <p> Built-up area is defined as the area occupied by buildings and other  constructions.</p> 
  <p>  Open urbanised space refers mainly to the unequipped area,  including the open areas, forests, cultural land, parks, unequipped urban  areas, ecological fields.</p> 
  <p>  Public spaces are considered to be all the  places which are held publicly or are of public use, accessible and pleasant  to all, free of charge and without profit, classified in streets, open spaces  and public facilities. Open space for public includes: parks, recreation areas  (inc. playgrounds, rivers, riparian area, public beach, etc.), public gardens,  markets/squares and alleys.</p> 
  <p>  Legal basis: Law no. 29 (5.04.18) on  Delimitation of Public Properties, Regulation on the way to delimit public  immovable property assets (GD no. 63 (11.02.19)) </p>

  <p> Built-up area of cities that is open space for public use  = Total area of  open space for public + Total area of land allocated for streets / Total area  of built-up surfaces of urban localities  * 100. </p> 
  <p>  Method for estimating  the public space area is based on three stages: </p> 
  <p>  a) spatial analysis to  delimit the built-up area of cities - to delimit the built-up areas of urban  localities/agglomerations and to calculate their total surface (square  kilometres). Maps will be generated on land use and inventories will be made  through works in the field so as to identify public areas. </p> 
  <p>  b) estimation  of total area of the open space for public - the total area of open space for  public will be mapped and calculated within the urban limits, defines based on  the built-up areas of the cities. The inventory of the open space for public  will be digitalised and vectorised using the GIS software so as to allow  calculating the areas. The total area of the open space for public will be  proportionate to the total built-up area of the city so as to obtain the share  of open spaces allocated for public.</p> 
  <p>  c) estimation of the total area  allocated for streets, the land related to the street networks from the  built-up area of the locality, and borders are determined as an integral  immovable property, for each street separately (identified by the name of the  street), within the limits of a cadastre sector </p>

  <p> The national indicator is described per general according to the metadata of  the global indicator.</p> 
  <p>  The national indicator will be reviewed after  finalizing the process of delimiting the public property areas into public  property fields of the state and public property fields of administrative -  territorial units, including into fields of public or private domain. </p>
