  <p> The aim of this indicator is to measures the trends from: </p> 
  <p>  Part A:  Commitment of the country to relevant international agreements,  especially:</p> 
  <p>  (1) National adoption of international policies relevant for  alien invasive species.</p> 
  <p>  (2) Existence of: (a) national strategies to  prevent and control alien invasive species; </p> 
  <p>  (b) national legislation  and policies relevant for alien invasive species.</p> 
  <p>  Part B: Transposition  of political agreements in country's actions to implement policies and to  prevent and control pro-actively invasive alien species IAS, and to allocate  resources for these activities</p> 
  <p>  (3) National allocation of  resources to prevent or control invasive alien species. </p> 
  <p>  Conservation of  natural habitats is one of the essential elements for protection of wild flora  and fauna. In this context, the Republic of Moldova has included in its  national policy a number of provisions regarding prevention of appearance and  counteracting of invasive species, as follows: (i) Strategy on Biological  Diversity of the Republic of Moldova and the Action Plan for implementing it  (GD no. 274/2015);  (ii) Law on Vegetal Kingdom No. 239/2007;  (iii) Law on  Animal Kingdom No. 439/1995.</p> 
  <p>  Reporting is focused on a number of  criteria:</p> 
  <p>  • Necessary research and work as basis for protection,  management and sustainable use of birds' populations;</p> 
  <p>  • Information on  derogated species' conservation status;</p> 
  <p>  • Authority empowered to declare  that conditions were met;</p> 
  <p>  • Risk conditions, circumstances, time and  place for which exceptions are provided;</p> 
  <p>  • Justification for derogation  of a species in unfavourable conservation condition;</p> 
  <p>  • Alternative  solutions taken into consideration and scientific data to compare them, etc." </p>
