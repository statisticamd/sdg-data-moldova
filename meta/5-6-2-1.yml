  The aim of the indicator is to provide international comparability in line  with the Action Plan of the Conference on Population and Development in 1994,  the Action Plan of the Beijing Platform and international standards of human  rights under implementation. The indicator tries to assess the extent to which  the country has the set of legislative and normative acts guaranteeing full  and equal access to women and men aged 15 years old and over to services of  reproductive health, information and education. It represents a score on a  scale from 0 to 100 (legislative and normative framework guaranteeing full and  equal access), indicating thus the status and the progress of the country in  relation to existence of legislative and normative frameworks, but not the  level of their implementation.

  <p> The indicator reflects the existence of national legislative-normative  framework guaranteeing women and men aged 15-49 years old access to services  under 4 thematic areas: (i) Services for maternity protection; (ii)  Contraception and family planning; (iii) Information and comprehensive  education; (iv) Sexual health and wellbeing </p> 
  <p>  Indicator is a qualitative  one of "Yes/No" type.</p> 
  <p>  At the global level, the indicator is produced once  per 2-3 years under a survey based on an electronic questionnaire and measures  specific legal rights and barriers related to 13 components under 4 thematic  areas: (i) Services for maternity protection; (ii) Contraception and family  planning; (iii) Information and comprehensive education; (iv) Sexual health  and wellbeing. The 13 components are placed on the same scale with a score  from 0% to 100% . Every component is calculated separately and weighted in  equal way. The score for each component is calculated as follows: ((Number of  existing rights/Total number of rights) - (Total number of existing barriers /  Total number of barriers))*100</p> 
  <p>  Total score for the indicator is  calculated as an arithmetic average of the 13 component scores. The score for  each thematic area is calculated in a similar way, meaning as an arithmetic  average of the scores of its constitutive components.</p> 
  <p>  The global  indicator is compiled by UNFPA, based on the data of UNFPA offices by the  country which coordinates the carrying out of the survey and the process of  data validation. </p>
