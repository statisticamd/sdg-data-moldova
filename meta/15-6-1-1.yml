  <p> The indicator refers to protected genetic resources (objects of local  protected plant and animal kingdoms), collections of genetic resources and  scientific investigations in the area.</p> 
  <p>  The indicator is under the scope  of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and  Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention  on Biological Diversity (CBD) (Rio de Janeiro, 5 June 1992 ), which is in  force for the Republic of Moldova since 21.11.2016 , in which the following  expressions are used:</p> 
  <p>  Biological resources includes genetic resources,  organisms or parts thereof, populations, or any other biotic component of  ecosystems with actual or potential use or value for humanity.</p> 
  <p>  Genetic  resources means genetic material of actual or potential value. </p> 
  <p>  Genetic  material means any material of plant, animal, microbial or other origin  containing functional units of heredity</p> 
  <p>  Country of origin of genetic  resources means the country which possesses those genetic resources in in-situ  conditions.</p> 
  <p>  Country providing genetic resources means the country  supplying genetic resources collected from in-situ sources, including  populations of both wild and domesticated species, or taken from ex-situ  sources, which may or may not have originated in that country. </p> 
  <p>  Use of  genetic resources means performance of research and development works  regarding the genetic and/or biochemical composition of genetic resources,  including by applying biotechnology, according to the definition from art. 2  of the CBD;</p> 
  <p>  Biotechnology means any technological application that uses  biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or  modify </p>
