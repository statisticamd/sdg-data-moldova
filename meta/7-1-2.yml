  Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology  is calculated as the number of people using clean fuels and technologies for  cooking, heating and lighting divided by total population reporting any  cooking, heating or lighting, expressed as percentage. “Clean” is defined by  the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against  unprocessed coal and kerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO  guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion.

  <p> The following shall be considered as primary sources of energy: natural gas, petroleum (liquid) gas, electricity, fire wood, agricultural waste, biomass, other. Solid fuels are considered to be polluting and non modern, while the non-solid fuels are considered to be "clean". Solid fuels (such as wood, coal, agricultural waste) or kerosene associated with inefficient technologies / devices (open fire, individual ovens, space heaters or lamps) - are considered inefficient energy sources for cooking, heating and lighting and are associated with high levels of pollution within the household.</p> 
  <p>   Other: The "clean" energy source is defined depending on the emission rate of the respective energy sources - [see WHO Guide on quality of indoor air: burning of domestic fuel](https://www.who.int/airpollution/guidelines/household-fuel-combustion/en/).
