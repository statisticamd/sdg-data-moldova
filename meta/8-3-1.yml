  In contexts where social protection coverage is limited, social security benefits (such as unemployment insurance) are insufficient or even inexistent, and/or where wages and pensions are low, individuals may have to take up informal employment to ensure their livelihood. In these situations, indicators such as the unemployment rate would provide a very incomplete picture of the labour market situation, overlooking major deficits in the quality of employment. Statistics on informality are key to assessing the quality of employment in an economy and are relevant to developing and developed countries alike.
