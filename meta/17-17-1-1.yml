  <p> Civil Society Development Strategy for 2018–2020 (GD. 51/2018)  reflects the  commitment of the Republic of Moldova to enhance systematically the conditions  for dynamic development of the civil society. Being built on the principles of  mutual trust, partnership, transparency, participation and political  non-partisanship, the Strategy continues the efforts initiated within the  implementation of the previous strategies for civil society development and  focuses on the same priorities. Monitoring and evaluation of the Strategy is  carried out through the tools envisaged in its section 5 "Monitoring and  Evaluation of the Strategy”. The Government, in cooperation with the civil  society organizations, submits annually to the Parliament, by the 31st of  March, a report on implementation of the strategy and fulfilment of the action  plan.</p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Given that the Civil Society Development Strategy for the period 2018-2020 expired in 2020, the next policy document will be considered for the following years to monitor the situation in the field, which will be developed in 2023. </p>
