  Household expenditures for health are defined as any expenditures made during  the use of the service for obtaining any type of care (promotional, preventive, curative, rehabilitation, palliative or long-term care), including  all the medicines, vaccines and other pharmaceutical items, as well as all the health products, of any type of supplier and for all members of the household. These expenditures for health are characterised by direct payments financed from the incomes (including remittances) of a household, from savings or loans, but do not include the reimbursement of the third parties' payer (meaning are not partially or fully compensated). The components of consumption expenditures for consumption for health services should comply with division 06 on health from COICOP, which includes the expenditures for medicines and medical products (06.1), outpatient services (06.2) and inpatient services (06.3).
