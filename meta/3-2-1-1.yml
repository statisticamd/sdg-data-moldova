  The probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before  reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age specific mortality rates of  that period, expressed per 1000 live births. The under-five mortality rate as  defined here is, strictly speaking, not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths  divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time)  but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as a rate  per 1000 live births.
