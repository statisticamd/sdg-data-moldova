  <p> Degraded land – land fields, regardless of their ownership right, which  through erosion, pollution or destructive actions of some anthropogenic  factors, have lost for good their agricultural production capacity, but which  may be improved by reforestation and works for ecosystems' recovery, for the  purpose of protecting the soil, recovering the hydrological balance and  improving the environmental conditions. The degraded areas may be part within  the land cadastre of the following categories: agricultural fields, other  fields (clough, landslides, etc.), water, etc. The degraded land  includes:</p> 
  <p>  a) fields with very severe and excessive surface erosion;</p> 
  <p>   b) fields with depth erosion – clough, trenches;</p> 
  <p>  c) fields affected by  active landslides, crashes and cave-ins;</p> 
  <p>  d) sandy fields subject to wind  or water erosion;</p> 
  <p>  e) salty fields;</p> 
  <p>  f) fields polluted with chemical  or oil substances;</p> 
  <p>  g) fields covered by open quarry, with mining  tailings, with production waste or domestic waste, etc.;</p> 
  <p>  h) affected or  destroyed biota fields;</p> 
  <p>  i) fields with gravel, scree, rocks, torrential  alluvial deposits;</p> 
  <p>  j) non-productive fields (Government Decision No.1186  of 28.10.2016 approving the Regulation on performing reforestation works on  degraded fields under public property of administrative-territorial units and  degraded fields under private property). </p>
