  <p> The indicator measures the satisfaction of the population with the quality of  public services, based on the last experience of accessing such services (over  the last 12 months) in the following three areas: a) health; b) education and  c) public services, named according to the global metadata as „administrative  services”. The indicator is based on surveys, which reflect the general  perceptions of citizens aged 18 years + based on experiences regarding the  availability and quality of services which were effectively provided to survey  participants. The respondents are requested to tell about the last experiences  in relation to each service and to assess it according to the five „criteria”  or  standards for a certain service: (1) access, (2) accessibility, (3)  quality of facilities, (4) equal treatment, (5) attitude of medical personnel  (kindness and treatment), quality of teaching from teaching personnel,  promptness in provision of public services. The last question is addressed to  respondents about their general level of satisfaction with each of the  services.</p> 
  <p>  The questions regarding the health, education and public  services may be introduced in existing surveys, using the additional elements  from these demographic surveys for subsequent disaggregation of results. This  method of „module completion” also allows to cross the levels of satisfactions  with other social-economic variables from the wider survey, such as the  respondent's health condition. This allows analysing more comprehensively the  disparities in service supply and helps to identify the specific factors which  influence the level of satisfaction. </p>
