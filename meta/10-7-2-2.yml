  Bilateral agreements in the area of labour migration represent tools for  regulating circular migration, decreasing irregular migration and protecting  migrant workers' rights in the countries of destination. The areas for  applying the respective agreements include: (i) ensuring protection of migrant  workers' rights and freedoms in line with the legislation of both countries;  (ii) promotion of temporary legal work, return and social-economic  reintegration of migrant workers; (iii) decreasing negative effects on  migrants and their families.
