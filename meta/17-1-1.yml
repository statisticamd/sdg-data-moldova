  <p> Budgetary revenues are defined according to chapter 4, para. 4.23 of [the  Government Finance Statistics  Manual](https://www.imf.org/external/Pubs/FT/GFS/Manual/2014/gfsfinal.pdf)  developed by the IMF.</p> 
  <p>  The budgetary revenues are generated from: a) taxes  and fees (GFS code 11); b) state social insurance contribution and compulsory  health insurance premiums (GFS code 12); c) grants for supporting the budget  and for projects finances from foreign sources (GFS code 13); d) other  revenues envisaged by law (GFS code 14).</p> 
  <p>  Compulsory transfers and fees  are the main revenue sources for the majority of governmental entities.  Especially, taxes are mandatory amounts received by governmental entities from  institutional entities. Social contributions are real or imputed revenues from  the social insurance schemes for ensuring the payment of social insurance  benefits. Subsidies are the transfers received by governmental entities from  other residential or non-residential governmental units, or international  organizations, which do not meet the definition/condition of a fee, subsidy or  social contribution. Other revenues include: (i) property income; (ii) sale of  goods and services ; (iii) fines, penalties and forfeits; (iv) transfers which  are not classified in other parts and (v) premiums, fees and receivables  related to life insurance and standardised guarantee schemes.</p> 
  <p>  The data  for this indicator are collected annually by the IMF Statistics Department, in  Table 1 of the standardised questionnaire. Data are submitted in national  currency expressed as a proportion of the GDP, where the GDP is derived from  the IMF database World Economic Outlook (without applying adjustments and  weighting techniques). </p>
