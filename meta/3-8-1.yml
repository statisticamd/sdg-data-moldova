  <p> The average coverage with essential health services is assessed based on the  monitoring procedures for reproductive health, maternal health, new-borns'  health and children's health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases  and the service capacity and access, among the general population and the most  deprived population. The 14 indicators tracing the coverage with health  services are grouped in 4 categories:</p> 
  <p> I. Reproductive, maternal, newborn  and child health: </p> 
  <p>  1)Family planning: Share of women of reproductive age  (15-49 years old) with their family planning needs satisfied through modern  methods of contraception (Indicator SDG 3.7.1.);</p> 
  <p>  2) Pregnancy and  delivery care: Share of women aged 15-49 years old with live births in a  determined period of time, who received antenatal care four or more times;  </p> 
  <p>  3) Child immunization: Share of children who received three vaccine  doses containing diphtheria - tetanus -pertussis;</p> 
  <p>  4)Children's treatment:  Share of children aged under 5 years old with suspected pneumonia (cough,  dyspnoea, not due to a chest problem or sunny nose) during two week before  examination by the corresponding medical institution.</p> 
  <p>  II. Infectious  diseases:</p> 
  <p>  5) TB: share of new TB cases detected and successfully  treated;</p> 
  <p>  6) HIV/AIDS: Share of persons living with HIV receiving  antiretroviral treatment;</p> 
  <p>  7) Malaria: Share of persons from endemic areas  for malaria, who sleep during the night under an insecticide-treated net (Not  relevant for Moldova);</p> 
  <p>  8)Water and sanitation: Share of households using  at least basic sanitation facilities;</p> 
  <p>  III. Non-communicable  diseases:</p> 
  <p>  9)Hypertension: Age-standardized prevalence of non-raised blood  pressure (systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure <90  mm Hg) among adults aged 18 years and older;</p> 
  <p>  10) Diabetes:  Age-standardized mean fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) for adults aged 18 years  and older;</p> 
  <p>  11) Tobacco: Age-standardized prevalence of adults >=15 years  not smoking tobacco in last 30 days (Indicator SDG 3.a.1. - see the  description there);</p> 
  <p> IV. Service capacity and access </p> 
  <p>  12) Hospital  access: Hospital beds per capita, relative to a maximum threshold of 18 per  10,000 population;</p> 
  <p>  13) Health workforce: Health professionals  (physicians, psychiatrists, and surgeons) per capita, relative to maximum  thresholds for each cadre (part of indicator SDG 3.c.1.);</p> 
  <p>  14) Health  security: International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity index, which is  the average percentage of attributes of 13 core capacities that have been  attained (SDG. 3.d.1. global metadata). </p>
