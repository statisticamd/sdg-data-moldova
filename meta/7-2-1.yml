  <p> Energy from renewable sources represents the energy obtained by harnessing  renewable unused sources, respectively wind energy, solar energy, aerothermal  energy, geothermal energy, hydrothermal energy and ocean energy, hydro-power  energy, biomass, biogas, waste fermentation gas (storage gas) and gas obtained  from wastewater treatment installations. Final gross consumption of energy -  energy products supplied for the energy purposes of industry, transportation,  residential sector, services, including public services, agriculture,  forestry, fishery, including consumption of electricity and thermal energy  from electricity and thermal energy producing, as well as technologic  consumption and losses of electricity and thermal energy in electricity and  thermal networks.</p> 
  <p>  Final gross consumption of energy from renewable  sources is calculated as the sum of the following: a) final gross consumption  of electricity from renewable sources; b) final gross consumption of energy  from renewables sources for heating and cooling; c) final gross consumption of  energy from renewable sources in transportation. </p>
