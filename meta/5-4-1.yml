  The purpose of the indicator is to measure the amount of time women and men spend doing unpaid work, to ensure that all work, whether paid or unpaid, is valued.  In addition, it also provides an assessment of gender equality, by highlighting discrepancies between how much time women and men spend on unpaid work, like cooking, cleaning or taking care of children.
