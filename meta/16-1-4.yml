  The indicator refers to the proportion of adult population who feels safe  while walking in the neighbourhood where they reside. The data for calculating  this indicator are collected through sample-based surveys in general  population, and most frequently the surveys on victimization are carried out  for this purpose. There is a question in the surveys on victimization: "How  safe do you feel when walking by yourself in your area/neighbourhood?”, and  the answer options are: very safe/ sufficiently safe / not so safe / very  unsafe / never walk alone in the evenings and at night / do not know
