  <p> "Good or acceptable" roads mean:</p> 
  <p>   i) paved road with IRI (international road index) less than 6 meters / km and unpaved road with IRI less than 13 meters / km, when IRI data is available</p> 
  <p>   ii) Paved road in excellent, good or fair condition and unpaved road in excellent or good condition when IRI data is not available but other road condition data such as PCI or visual rating by class is available.</p> 
  <p>   National roads – roads that are public property of the state, which provide main international road links, the connection between the capital of the country and the cities-residence, municipalities and objectives of republican importance, as well as the connection between them.</p> 
  <p>   Local roads include: a) roads of district (municipal) interest - which ensure the connection between the cities-residence and the villages (municipalities) of the district (municipality), as well as the connection between villages (municipalities), including access to them from the national roads. b) communal roads - which ensure the connection between the village-residence of the commune and the component villages or between them and the objectives of communal interest; c) streets – public roads inside the localities that are public property of the administrative-territorial units of the first level or, as the case may be, of the municipalities of Chisinau and Balti.</p> 
  <p>   According to the Roads Law (509), art.2, para.(5) Depending on the type of road structure, roads are divided into: a) roads with capital (permanent) road structure - with asphalt concrete or cement concrete surface; b) roads with light road structure (semi-permanent) - with road surface made of local materials coated with bituminous binders; c) roads with temporary road structure - paved roads.</p> 
  <p>   According to the NBS, hardwearing roads include upgraded roads and paved roads. Modernized roads are those whose carriageway is covered with one of the following categories: concrete-cement, asphalt, cut stone pavements and hardened with hydro-carbon binders. Paved roads are those whose carriageway has one of the following types of construction: rough stone or boulder paving, improved paving or plain paving. Dirt roads - (unpaved) is considered the road with a stabilized base, which is not covered with crushed stone, asphalt binder or bituminous agents, cement or stone paving. </p>
