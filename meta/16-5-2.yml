  <p> Proportion of enterprises from whom a present or an informal payment (bribe)  was requested, when they met fiscal officials. The data for this indicator are  collected within [enterprises' surveys](http://www.enterprisesurveys.org),  which include a standard question in which respondents are asked if they have  been subject to an inspection or have been invited to meet with the  representatives of tax authorities. If the respondents answer „yes”, there is  a follow-up question, in which they are asked if it is expected for them to  provide a present or to make an unofficial payment during such inspections /  meetings. The response options are: „yes”, „no”, „do not know” and  „refuse”.</p> 
  <p>  Enterprises' surveys are surveys carried out in enterprises in  the World Bank's client countries. The survey focuses on different business  environment aspects, as well as on outcome measures of the company, such as  annual sale, productivity, etc. The survey is carried out for every country  for about 4-5 years.</p> 
  <p>  The data for this indicator at the national level  may be extracted from two sources: </p> 
  <p> 1) Survey from 2015, based on the  question: "Over the last year, have you (or anyone from your enterprise) made  unofficial payment or offered presents to employees of the following  institutions/services/areas?"</p> 
  <p> 2) Survey from 2018, based on the questions:  "Have you interacted with the following institutions over the last 12 months?   Have you made unofficial payments over the last 12 months? Have you offered  presents over the last 12 months?" </p>

  The national indicator is similar to the global one, but the differences are  as follows: the source for data collection differs, as for the global  indicator they use surveys in enterprises carried out based on the World Bank  methodology once per 4-5 years. Another difference would be the different  questions in the national survey questionnaires carried out in 2015 and 2018,  as well as certain difference in the data calculation formulas
