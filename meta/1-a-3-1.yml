  The main aim of the social protection programs is to prevent and reduce  poverty and social exclusion. Social insurance programs have the role to  partially compensate such social risks as: old age, disease, maternity, work  accidents and occupational diseases, disability and loss of bread-winner, the  occurrence of which lead to reducing/losing the incomes and increasing the  poverty risk (ILO Convention No. 102/1952 on Minimum Social Security Norms).  At their turn, the social assistance programs, through the set of social  benefits based on non-contribution principles and social services (primary,  specialised, and highly specialised) have a significate role for reducing  poverty and preventing social exclusion of different groups of persons. The  share of expenditures for social protection of population in the GDP reflects  the efforts undertaken by the state for redistributing the available resources  for reducing population poverty.
