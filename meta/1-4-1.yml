  <p> The basic services refer to the systems providing public services which meet the basic needs of the population, including access to safe drinking water, improved sewerage and hygiene, modern energy, mobility and transport, collecting solid waste, healthcare, education, green spaces (recreation) and information technologies.</p> 
  <p>  The nationalised indicator 1.4.1 refers to a part of basic infrastructure  services - the ones available in the households, and namely electricity lighting, safe water sources, improved sewerage system, connection to Internet.  </p> 
  <p>  The rest of the basic services to which the population has access, mainly outside the households, will be measured through other SDG indicators (on access to health services/SDG3, education/SDG4, transport/SDG9&11, waste and green spaces/SDG11). </p>
SDG_INDICATOR_INFO__GLOBAL: >-
  Basic services refer to public service provision systems that meet human basic needs including drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, energy, mobility, waste collection, health care, education and information technologies. The basis cervices indicator will be therefore based on 9 components. These components are captured in various standalone indicators of the SDGs, which means that the concepts and definitions of SDG indicator 1.4.1 will be derived from or are the same as those of these specific SDG indicators.
