  The indicator measures the total value of illicit financial flows entering and  exiting the country (IFF) expressed in current USD. IFFs are financial flows  which are illicitly generated (for instance, originating from illegal proceed  or tax evasion), illicit transfers (such as violation of foreign currency  controls) or illicit use (for instance, for terrorism financing).

  <p> A process in two stages was developed, which helps the member states to  calculated the indicator, which envisages:</p> 
  <p>  1) An assessment of the rick  identifying the major and the most relevant illicit financial flows (IFF) in a  country. This risk assessment may follow and may be based on the existing risk  assessments, for instance, the ones authorised by FATF.</p> 
  <p>  2) Once the  activities generating most of the important flows are identified, they should  be estimated in a disaggregated manner. </p> 
  <p>  A first step for building the  indicator is to focus it on the IFF types generated in the process of  obtaining illicit revenues: this refers to the set of transactions - such as  those related to international trade with illicit goods - which either  generate directly illicit revenues for a subject during an illicit productive  or non-productive activity or which are carried out in the context of illicit  production of goods and services.</p> 
  <p>  In this context, the global methodology  provided an example for estimating IFF obtained from illegal  transportation/trafficking of migrants, which according to the Eurostat Manual  on Compiling Statistics regarding illegal economic activities in national  accounts and balance of payments, may distinguish four types of smuggling  transactions, out of which two generate IFF:</p> 
  <p>  Type I: Resident smugglers  and resident migrants do not cover the transnational nature and illegal entry  and do no create IFF </p> 
  <p>  Type II: Resident smugglers and non-resident  migrants - means export of services and has within IFF:</p> 
  <p>  Export of  transport services = number of non-resident migrants transported illegally /  trafficked by resident smugglers * prices </p> 
  <p>  Type III: Non-resident  smugglers and resident migrants, estimated registered as import of illegal  services and represents external IFF:</p> 
  <p>  Import of illegal transport =  number of illegally transported/trafficked residents by non-resident smugglers  * prices </p> 
  <p>  Type IV: Non-resident smugglers and non-resident migrants - no  estimates were registered here</p> 
  <p>  Pilot studies carried out in 5 countries  have determined that this methodology is possible, nevertheless there are data  limitations, especially in relation to establishing the prices.</p> 
  <p>  At the  second step the IFF are estimated in relation to illicit management of  revenues. These refer to the IFF generated when the revenues obtained from  illegal activities are invested abroad (for instance, in properties). To  assess these flows, quantitative and qualitative information may be used, as  obtained from financial authorities, central banks, and other entities  involved in money laundering and financial offences. </p>
