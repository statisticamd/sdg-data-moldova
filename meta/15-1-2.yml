  <p> Biodiversity - variability of living organisms from land and marine ecosystems, from other aquatic ecosystems and ecological complexes whose components they are; this term covers intraspecific and interspecific diversity, ecosystem diversity;</p> 
  <p>   Ecosystem - dynamic complex of associations of plants, animals, fungi and microorganisms, as well as the totality of abiotic environmental factor, whose interaction represents an integral functional unit;</p> 
  <p>   Protected area - natural space, geographically delimited, with representative and rare natural elements, assigned and regulated for the purpose of conservation and protection of all environmental factors within its limits (Law No. 1538 of 25.02.1998 on Fund of State Protected Natural Areas); </p>
