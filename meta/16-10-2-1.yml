  Freedom of information - an important element of freedom of expression, which  includes the right to receive, as well as to distribute information, opinions,  ideas, being a general desideratum at the international level. Public  authorities, according to the held mandates, are obliged to ensure the correct  information of citizens about the public matters and problems of personal  interest. The adequate regime of freedom of information is a vital aspect of  the activity of an open government and society democratization. Only when  there is a free exchange of information, accountability may be ensured,  corruption may be avoided at the power levels, and the right of the citizens  to know may be met.

  <p> The indicator is calculated based on quantitative and qualitative data, which  are generated based on analysis of existing studies (such as: UNESCO reports  regarding the world trends in freedom of expression and media development,  etc.), administrative data, experts' analyses (for instance: World Justice  Index of Open Government), etc. The following key variables will be  evaluated:</p> 
  <p>  1. If the country has constitutional, statutory and/or  political guarantees for public access to information?</p> 
  <p>  2. If these  constitutional, statutory and/or political guarantees reflect the well-known  international agreements (for instance, Universal Declaration of Human Rights,  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, etc.)?</p> 
  <p>  3. What are  the implementation mechanisms which secure that these guarantees operate in an  optimal way? </p>
