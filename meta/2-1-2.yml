  The indicator measures the percentage of individuals in the population who have experienced food insecurity at moderate or severe levels during the reference period. The severity of food insecurity, defined as a latent trait, is measured on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale global reference scale, a measurement standard established by FAO through the application of the Food Insecurity Experience Scale in more than 140 countries worldwide, starting in 2014.

  <p> The indicator (together with the malnutrition rate) is used to measure the food deprivation and is compiled by FAO. To calculate the indicator for the Republic of Moldova, NBS will send to FAO the data at the national level collected within the module FIES (8 questions of  'Yes/No' type) ( [by integrating in the HBS questionnaires](http://www.fao.org/3/a-be898r.pdf - Russian) or completing the HBS questionnaires with missing questions).</p> 
  <p>  FIES indicators may generate disaggregated information to identify groups of population which are most affected by food insecurity, and also may be used to assess the factors which determine food insecurity.</p> 
  <p>  Prevalence of food insecurity is moderate or severe, and severe. </p>
