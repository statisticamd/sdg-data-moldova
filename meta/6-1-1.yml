  The proportion of the population using safely managed drinking water services is defined as the proportion of population using an improved drinking water source which is accessible on premises, available when needed and free from faecal and priority chemical contamination. ‘Improved’ drinking water sources include: piped supplies, boreholes and tubewells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, water kiosks, and packaged and delivered water.

  <p> Safe sources of water supply include: aqueduct inside the dwelling and aqueduct  outside the dwelling, including public  network aqueduct, artesian well, spring well.</p> 
  <p>   Aqueduct within the dwelling is considered when there is a network of water  distribution within the premises, through which water comes from centralised  networks, artesian well, own well, as well house with isolated kitchen in  which a tap is installed from the network of water distribution.</p> 
  <p>  Aqueduct  outside the dwelling - when the household has a tap with water located in the  courtyard, and the network does not get to the dwelling. </p>

  UN definition for MICS - water supplied through aqueduct in the dwelling/household, protected well/spring was not taken into consideration if  the sanitary protection zone is organised or not, as well as distance up to the possible pollution sources. At the same time the access to improved source does not mean automatically access to safe sources of drinking water, and this may be determined only by competent authorities after quality investigation, which was not the object of the given study.
