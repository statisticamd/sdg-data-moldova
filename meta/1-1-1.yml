  ## Definition:

  The proportion of the employed population below the international poverty line
  of US$1.90 per day, also referred to as the working poverty rate, is defined
  as the share of employed persons living in households with per-capita
  consumption or income that is below the international poverty line of US$1.90.

  ## Concepts:

  **Employment:** All persons of working age who, during a short reference
  period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide
  services for pay or profit.


  **Poverty Line:** Threshold below which individuals in the reference
  population are considered poor and above which they are considered non-poor.
  The threshold is generally defined as the per-capita monetary requirements an
  individual needs to afford the purchase of a basic bundle of goods and
  services. For the purpose of this indicator, an absolute international poverty
  line of US$1.90 per day is used.


  **Household in poverty:** Households are defined as poor if their income or
  consumption expenditure is below the poverty line taking into account the
  number of household members and composition (e.g., number of adults and
  children).


  **Working poor:** Employed persons living in households that are classified as
  poor, that is, that have income or consumption levels below the poverty line
  used for measurement.
