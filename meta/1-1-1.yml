  ## Definition:
  
  The proportion of the employed population below the international poverty
  line of US$1.90 per day, also referred to as the working poverty rate, is
  defined as the share of employed persons living in households with per-capita
  consumption or income that is below the international poverty line of
  US$1.90.
  
  ## Concepts:
  
  **Employment:** All persons of working age who,
  during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to
  produce goods or provide services for pay or profit.
  
  
  **Poverty Line:** Threshold below which individuals
  in the reference population are considered poor and above which they are
  considered non-poor. The threshold is generally defined as the per-capita
  monetary requirements an individual needs to afford the purchase of a basic
  bundle of goods and services. For the purpose of this indicator, an absolute
  international poverty line of US$1.90 per day is used.
  
  
  **Household in poverty:** Households are defined as
  poor if their income or consumption expenditure is below the poverty line
  taking into account the number of household members and composition (e.g.,
  number of adults and children).
  
  
  **Working poor:** Employed persons living in
  households that are classified as poor, that is, that have income or
  consumption levels below the poverty line used for measurement.
