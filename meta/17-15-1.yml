  The aim of the indicator is to try to see the general behaviour of the  development partners in developing new intervention measures in the country,  taking into account and observing the country's priorities. According to the  global metadata, the monitoring of this indicator is a voluntary process led  by every country separately. The Government of the country leads and  coordinates the collection and validation of data.

  <p> The indicator calculates the extent to which the objectives, results-based  indicator and monitoring indicators related to the new development  interventions are extracted from governmental sources, including: national,  sector and local planning tools. For every significant development  intervention (100.000 USD or more) approved during the year of reference, the  following parameters are assessed:</p> 
  <p>  Q1. If the objectives are extracted  from the results frameworks, government plans and strategies. where: </p> 
  <p>  0,  Objectives are not extracted from the results frameworks, plans and strategies  implemented by the Government; 1, Objectives are extracted from results  frameworks, plans and strategies implemented by the Government;</p> 
  <p>  Q2. Share  of outcome (output) indicators which are extracted from the results  frameworks, plans and strategies of the government, % </p> 
  <p>  where: Numerator  (no): Number of outcome (output) indicators extracted from the results  frameworks of the Government or other existing planning documents; Denominator  (n): Total number of outcome (output) indicators included in the project's  results framework.</p> 
  <p>  Q3. Share of outcome (output) indicators which will be  based on the data sources supplied by the existing monitoring systems in the  country or by the national statistics services to trace the progress of the  indicator %. Where: Numerator (ns): Number of outcome (output) indicators to  be traced using the governmental statistics, the data sources or the  Monitoring and Evaluation system (meaning sources that are not specific to the  project); Denominator (n): Total number of outcome (output) indicators  included from the project results' framework.</p> 
  <p>  Aggregation of the  indicator is carried out by mediating the three dimensions of the alignment  with the national objectives and priorities of the new interventions in the  year of reference. The aggregation will not consider the size of the project,  so as to provide the same level of importance for the use level of the  national framework of results and planning tools in medium and small projects.  Otherwise, the weight depending on the size of the project will represent  excessively the infrastructure projects and will sub-represent the  interventions meant to influence the institutional policies and arrangements.  The calculation formula for aggregation of the indicator are presented on page  28 of [the following  source](http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdf) </p>
