FAO promotes the Agricultural Integrated Surveys (AGRIS) which collects data in a yearly basis for different modules, e.g. agricultural production. </p>\n<p>Currently, the indicator is produced mainly using the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) of the World Bank.

Such type of surveys are seldom collected at the national level. For this reason, the availability of data for the indicator is altogether limited.

For each country and year, the LCU labour value of production has to be converted into PPP 2011 USD. The process first consists on accounting for inflation in the currency, for which the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of each country is used; once deflated, it is converted into PPP 2011 USD, which allows for a homogenous standard of the indicator. SDG 2.3 not only focuses on small-scale farmers, but also on women and people with indigenous status.
