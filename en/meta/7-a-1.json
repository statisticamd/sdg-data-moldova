Data from the CRS are reported at the project level and can be disaggregated by type of flow (ODA or OOF), by donor, recipient country, type of finance, type of aid (project, agriculture sub-sector, etc.).</p>\n<p>Data in IRENA are stored by country (source and recipient) at the project-level, allowing disaggregation of the data in several dimensions. For example, financial flows can be divided by technologies (i.e. bioenergy, geothermal energy, hydropower, marine energy, solar energy, and wind energy) and sub-technologies (e.g. onshore and offshore wind), by geography (both at the country and regional level), by financial instrument and by type of recipient.</p>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>Neither OECD nor IRENA make estimates of these figures.
