Article 2 of CEDAW states: States Parties condemn discrimination against women in all its forms, agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating discrimination against women and, to this end, undertake: (a) To embody the principle of the equality of men and women in their national constitutions or other appropriate legislation if not yet incorporated therein and to ensure, through law and other appropriate means, the practical realization of this principle; (b) To adopt appropriate legislative and other measures, including sanctions where appropriate, prohibiting all discrimination against women; (c) To establish legal protection of the rights of women on an equal basis with men and to ensure through competent national tribunals and other public institutions the effective protection of women against any act of discrimination; (d) To refrain from engaging in any act or practice of discrimination against women and to ensure that public authorities and institutions shall act in conformity with this obligation; (e) To take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organization or enterprise; (f) To take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women; (g) To repeal all national penal provisions which constitute discrimination against women&#x201D;. </p>\n<p>The term &#x201C;legal frameworks&#x201D; is defined broadly to encompass laws, mechanisms, and policies/plans to &#x2018;promote, enforce and monitor&#x2019; gender equality. </p>\n<p>Legal frameworks that &#x201C;promote&#x201D; are those that establish women&#x2019;s equal rights with men and enshrine non-discrimination based on sex.

The World Bank Group&#x2019;s Women, Business and the Law and the OECD Development Centre&#x2019;s Social Institutions and Gender Index are two well-known global databases on national legal frameworks that promote gender equality which have been collecting data in this area for 10 and 9 years respectively. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-3\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>Data will be compiled every two years starting in 2018.</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>First quarter, every two years.</p>","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"<p>National counterparts, including National Statistical Offices and National Women&#x2019;s Machinery.</p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>The World Bank Group, the OECD Development Centre, UN Women</p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>The World Bank works closely with international agencies, regional development banks, donors, and other partners to develop frameworks, guidance, and standards of good practice for statistics, build consensus and define internationally agreed indicators, establish data exchange processes and methods, and help countries improve statistical capacity. Since 2009, the World Bank Group&#x2019;s Women, Business and the Law project has contributed to the study of gender equality and informed discussions on improving women&apos;s economic opportunities and empowerment through a unique dataset that measures the legal differences in access to economic opportunities between men and women in 190 economies. </p>\n<p>The OECD Development Centre&#x2019;s core mission is to provide a platform for evidence-based policy dialogue between OECD and non-OECD countries to design better policies, by identifying policy solutions to improve lives in developing countries. Through its Gender Programme, particularly since the creation of the Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) in 2009, the OECD Development Centre has played an instrumental role in highlighting the data gaps and fostering policy dialogue and mutual learning on the social institutions that discriminate against women and girls across their life cycle. It is also building the capacity of member states in data collection through the SIGI Country Studies, and advocates for more, better, and comparable data through its SIGI Global and Regional Reports and policy dialogue events.</p>\n<p>UN Women is committed through its work at the global, regional, and county level to support Member States in filling critical gaps in generating and using data, statistics, evidence, and analysis on gender equality in crucial areas. As part of its mandate, the organization supports Member States in setting norms. It conducts research, and compiles and provides evidence, including good practices and lessons learned, to inform intergovernmental debates and decisions. It also assists in implementing norms and standards through its country programs. In addition, it leads and <a href=\"https://www.unwomen.org/en/how-we-work/un-system-coordination\">coordinates</a> the UN system&#x2019;s work in support of gender equality and the empowerment of women.</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Equality and non-discrimination based on sex are core principles under the international legal and policy framework, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which has 189 States parties, and the Beijing Platform for Action. This framework sets out the commitments of States to eliminate discrimination against women and promote gender equality, including in the area of legal frameworks. </p>\n<p>In the Beijing Platform for Action, States pledged to revoke any remaining laws that discriminate based on sex. The five-year review and appraisal of the Beijing Platform for Action (Beijing +5) established 2005 as the target date for the repeal of laws that discriminate against women. This deadline has come and gone. While there has been progress in reforming laws to promote gender equality, discrimination against women in the law continues in many countries. Even where legal reforms have taken place, gaps in implementation persist.</p>\n<p>Removing discriminatory laws and putting in place legal frameworks that advance gender equality are prerequisites to ending discrimination against women and achieving gender equality (Goal 5, Target 5.1). Indicator 5.1.1 will be crucial in accelerating progress on the implementation of SDG 5 and all other gender-related commitments in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>To avoid duplication, the indicator does not cover areas of law that are addressed under indicator 5.a.2, &#x2018;Proportion of countries where the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women&#x2019;s equal rights to land ownership and/or control&#x2019;, and indicator 5.6.2, &#x2018;Number of countries with laws and regulations that guarantee full and equal access to women and men aged 15 years and older to sexual and reproductive health care, information and education&#x2019;.
