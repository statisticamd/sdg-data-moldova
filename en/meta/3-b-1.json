In the past decades all countries added numerous new and underutilised vaccines in their national immunization schedule and there are several vaccines under final stage of development to be introduced by 2030. For monitoring diseases control and impact of vaccines it is important to measure coverage from each vaccine in national immunization schedule. A system is already in place to monitor immunization coverage for all national programmes, however direct measurement for proportion of population covered with all vaccines in the programme is only feasible if the country has a well-functioning national electronic immunization registry allowing coverage by cohort to be easily estimated. While countries will develop and strengthen immunization registries there is a need for an alternative measurement.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The rational to select a set of vaccines reflects the ability of immunization programmes to deliver vaccines over the life cycle and to adapt new vaccines. Coverage for other WHO recommended vaccines are also available and can be provided. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Given that HPV vaccine is relatively new and vaccination schedule varies from countries to country coverage estimate will be made for girls vaccinated by ag 15 and at the moment data is limited to very few countries therefore reporting will start later. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>WHO and UNICEF jointly developed a methodology to estimate national immunization coverage form selected vaccines in 2000, and this approach has been refined and reviewed by expert committees over time.
