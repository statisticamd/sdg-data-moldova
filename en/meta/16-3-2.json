The data collection through the UN-CTS is facilitated by a network of over 130 national Focal Points appointed by responsible authorities. Data on unsentenced and total detainees from the UN-CTS are available for 114 countries. The country coverage can improve if other sources (research institutions and NGOs) are included (data for additional 60 countries are available, bringing the total for the period 2012-2014 to 174 countries). Data for two points in time (2003-2005 and 2012-2014 three year averages) are available for 144 countries.</p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>There is a consolidated system of annual data collection on crime and criminal justice (UN- Crime Trends Survey, UN-CTS) which represents the basis of data on unsentenced detainees. The UN-CTS data collection is largely based on the network of national Focal Points, which are institutions/officials appointed by countries and having the technical capacity and role to produce data on crime and criminal justice (around 130 appointed Focal Points as of 2016). In addition, these data are supplemented for countries with missing values with official data collected by the Institute for Criminal Policy Research (World Prison Brief), which collects data directly from national prison administrations or from the websites of Ministries of Justice or other official agencies.

This, in turn, is premised on aspects of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. From a development perspective, extensive use of pre-sentence detention when not necessary for reasons such as the prevention of absconding, the protection of victims or witnesses, or the prevention of the commission of further offences, can divert criminal justice system resources, and exert financial and unemployment burdens on the accused and his or her family. Measuring the relative extent to which pre-sentence detention is used can provide the evidence to assist countries in lowering such burdens and ensuring its proportionate use.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The target relates to the multidimensional concepts of rule of law and access to justice and at least two indicators are required to cover the main elements of access to justice and efficiency of the justice system.
