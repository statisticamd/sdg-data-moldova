Studies show that when people participate in the financial system, they are better able to start and expand businesses, invest in education, manage risk and absorb financial shocks. Measurement is key to understanding financial inclusion and identifying opportunities to remove barriers that may be preventing people from using financial services.

Data weighting is used to ensure a nationally representative sample for each economy. Final weights consist of the base sampling weight, which corrects for unequal probability of selection based on household size, and the poststratification weight, which corrects for sampling and nonresponse error. Poststratification weights use economy-level population statistics on gender and age and, where reliable data are available, education or socioeconomic status.

First, the data may deviate from supply side data which counts the number of accounts and may overstate the level of financial inclusion in a country if a significant number of adults have an account they do not use and did not formally close. Second, not all demand-side data is the same and that the data from different demand-side surveys cannot necessarily be compared if the survey method is different. In particular, surveys of individuals cannot be compared directly with surveys of household heads, since the use of financial services can differ considerably between different household members.</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>URL:</strong> </p>\n<p>https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex </p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong> </p>\n<p>Demirg&#xFC;&#xE7;-Kunt, Asli, Leora Klapper, Dorothe Singer, and Saniya Ansar. 2022.
