ODA is defined as flows of official financing administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective, and which are concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25 per cent (using a fixed 10 per cent rate of discount). By convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries (&#x201C;bilateral ODA&#x201D;) and to multilateral institutions.

Methodology on ODA data collection by OECD can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm\">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm</a>. </p>","QUALITY_ASSURE__GLOBAL":"<p>Data are collected using a converged reporting system whereby bilateral and multilateral providers of development co-operation use a single file format (Creditor Reporting System &#x2013; CRS) to report at item level on all flows of resources to developing countries. Item-level reporting is validated against key aggregates also reported by donors and then serves as the basis for producing various other aggregate statistics. For further details, see: <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm\">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm</a> </p>\n<p>A statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics in each providing country/agency. This reporter is usually located in the national aid agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc.</p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>Asia and Pacific: Most countries (at least 80% of the countries covering 90% of the population from the region)</p>\n<p>Africa: Most countries (at least 80% of the countries covering 90% of the population from the region)</p>\n<p>Latin America and the Caribbean: Most countries (at least 80% of the countries covering 90% of the population from the region)</p>\n<p>Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan: Some countries</p>\n<p>Please note that these reflect availability of data on total water and sanitation ODA.

While OECD captures a significant amount of the aid flows (as reported by external donors) to the water and sanitation sector, countries may receive development aid for water and sanitation from national and international donors that do not report to the OECD-CRS data system. Other differences may occur if recipient countries define development aid more or less rigorously than OECD&#x2019;s definition of ODA, or use different timeframes (e.g. fiscal year instead of calendar year) to report aid flows. In order to ensure data is as consistent as possible, the OECD will supply the reported ODA figures broken down to the project level, so that respondents can match these with their on-budget project data.</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>URL:</strong></p>\n<p>http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/glaas/en/</p>\n<p>http://www.unep.org/</p>\n<p>http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/data.htm</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>- UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water. http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/glaas/en/</p>\n<p>- UN-Water 2008: Status Report on IWRM for CSD-16, http://www.unwater.org/publications/publications-detail/en/c/206480/UNEP-DHI </p>\n<p>- UN-Water 2012: Status Reports on IWRM. http://www.unwater.org/publications/status-report-on-integrated-water-resources-management/en/ </p>\n<p>- Data from the 2012 Survey on the Application of Integrated Approaches to Water Resources Management. http://www.unepdhi.org/rioplus20 </p>\n<p>- UNEP 2016.
