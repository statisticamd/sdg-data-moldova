Observed discrepancies are routinely checked and validated with countries.</p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT__GLOBAL":"<p> Quality of statistics produced and disseminated by the FAO is evaluated in terms of fitness for use i.e. the degree to which statistics meet the user&#x2019;s requirements. The quality dimensions assessed are: Relevance; Accuracy and Reliability; Timeliness and Punctuality; Coherence and Comparability; Accessibility and Clarity. Quality dimensions definitions are provided in the FAO Statistical Quality Assurance Framework (SQAF), which provides the definition of quality and describes quality principles for statistical outputs; statistical processes; institutional environment (http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf). The SQAF is based on the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and the Principles Governing International Statistical Activities (CCSA). Adherence to these principles ensures the quality of FAO statistical production processes and of statistical outputs. Regular quality assessments are conducted through the FAO Quality Assessment and Planning Survey (QAPS), a bi-annual survey designed to gather information on all of FAO&#x2019;s statistical activities, which is used to assess the extent to which quality standards are being met with a view to increasing compliance with the SQAF, and to document best practices and provide guidance for improvement where necessary.</p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>Forest area data are available for all 236 countries and territories for the years , and2000, 2010, 2015, and every year since.</p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>No further disaggregation of this indicator.</p>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>The national figures in the database are reported by the countries themselves following standardized format, definitions and reporting years, thus eliminating any discrepancies between global and national figures.

Separate sections in the template country reports deal with the analysis of data (including any assumptions made and the methods used for estimates and projections to the common reporting years); calibration of data to the official land area as held by FAO; and reclassification of data to the classes used in FAO&#x2019;s Global Forest Resources Assessments.</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>URL:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/forest-resources-assessment/\">http://www.fao.org/forest-resources-assessment/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/faostat\">http://www.fao.org/faostat</a></p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020, Guidelines and Specifications (<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/I8699EN/i8699en.pdf\"><u>www.fao.org/3/I8699EN/i8699en.pdf</u></a>)</p>\n<p>Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020, Terms and Definitions </p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/I8661EN/i8661en.pdf\"><u>www.fao.org/3/I8661EN/i8661en.pdf</u></a>).</p>","target_number":"15.1","goal_number":"15","indicator_sort_order":"15-01-01"}
