  statistics, establishes the legal framework for the development, production, dissemination 
  and coordination of official statistics. It also contains provisions regarding 
  the fundamental principles of official statistics, professional independence, statistical 
  data quality management, expanding access to administrative data sources to reduce 
  the burden on respondents and other elements aimed at strengthening the national 
  statistical system.</p>
