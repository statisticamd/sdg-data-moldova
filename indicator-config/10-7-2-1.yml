  <p> ***Non-statistical indicator***</p> 
  <p>The national migration policy is developed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
  and the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP). The MMPS is responsible 
  for the legal framework for safe and informed work emigration, by managing circular 
  migration schemes, as well as regulating the activity of private employment agencies. 
  In this context, MLSP negotiates and signs bilateral agreements in the field of 
  labor migration, currently 3 bilateral agreements are functional: With the State 
  of Israel, regarding employment in construction; with Bulgaria, regarding employment 
  in different sectors; with Germany, regarding seasonal employment in agriculture. 
  About 2,000 people are employed annually based on these agreements. In 2021, the 
  legal framework that regulates the activity of private employment agencies was 
  developed and revised, by simplifying the licensing procedure, introducing the 
  condition of checking foreign intermediaries, obligations in relation to the people 
  they employ abroad, in particular regarding their information, involvement in conflict 
  resolution at work, as well as the control mechanism of private employment agencies 
  was introduced by State Labor Inspectorate. In addition, on the website www.angajat.md, 
  managed by National Agency of Labour Force Employment, the section on the conditions 
  of emigration for the purpose of work in several destination countries was developed.
