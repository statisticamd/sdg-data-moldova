  <p>For 2018-2022 years the answer is „YES” for i)  sustainable development, ii) 
  human rights, iii) gender equality, iv) education  for health and multidisciplinary 
  approach for setting the graduate profile.</p> 
  <p>Note: In 2018, the Curriculum Reform was started which determined the correlation 
  of curricular policies with national and international educational standards in 
  order to form the profile of the graduate through the prism of educational goals 
  and the key skills system. Curriculum area Counseling and personal development 
  includes the mandatory discipline Development personal, studied 1 hour per week, 
  in primary, secondary and high school education The reconceptualized school discipline 
  Education for society is compulsory for students in secondary and high school education 
  and has replaced the Civic Education discipline.</p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>(i) Sustainable development: The framework plan for primary, secondary and high 
  school education offers every student the opportunity to opt for optional subjects. 
  The optional subjects represent the flexible component of the Education Framework 
  Plan that contributes to the development of transversal skills. The priority areas 
  also include Education for Sustainable Development, which is oriented towards the 
  use of competences in the field of ecological education to understand and identify 
  solutions in case of local and global problems, such as those of sustainable development, 
  environment, green economy, energy conservation/ use of alternative energy sources/promotion 
  of energy efficiency measures, etc. The curriculum developed in 2018 for the Science 
  discipline in primary education also highlights the training of students' skills 
  and the interest in actively promoting environmental values and a healthy way of 
  life. The theme of ecological education is studied in educational institutions 
  within the framework of compulsory classes, optional classes and extracurricular 
  activities. The teaching staff orients the students, in school subjects related 
  to the pre-noted field, towards the use of skills in the field of ecological education, 
  for understanding and identifying solutions in the case of local and global problems, 
  as well as those of sustainable development, environment, green economy, conservation 
  energy and promoting energy efficiency measures. For the organization of optional 
  classes, teachers have the Curriculum for the optional discipline "Ecological Education" 
  for grades I-XII and the Curriculum for the optional discipline "Chemistry and 
  environmental exploration" for grades X-XII (approved by the National Curriculum 
  Council and by order ME no. 874 of September 8, 2015). At the same time, the Regional 
  Center for the Environment for Central and Eastern Europe in collaboration with 
  the MEC have developed didactic content on sustainable development and the application 
  of the Green Pack set in educational institutions.</p>

  <p>(ii) Human rights: The school discipline reconceptualized in 2018 Education 
  for society is mandatory for students in secondary and high school education and 
  has gradually replaced the discipline Civic Education. The implementation of the 
  discipline provides for the formation in students of the values of the rule of 
  law, the development of the necessary skills, the respect of the rights and responsibilities 
  of citizens through the prism of studying the integrated modules with reference 
  to Education for human rights, Education for democratic citizenship, Education

  and responsibilities, children in conflict with the law, breaking the law and punishment,

  component of the Education Framework Plan, which contributes to the development 
  of transversal skills. One of the priority areas for structuring the optional subjects 
  is Civics, which come to develop in students: Participation in civic life through 
  permanent information, understanding of political and administrative processes; 
  Exercising citizenship rights and obligations at local, national and international 
  level; Involvement in projects to solve community problems; Awareness of the importance 
  of individual decisions for local and global implications.</p>

  <p>  (iii) Gender equality: The mandatory discipline Education for society explicitly 
  contributes to the realization of the educational ideal by capitalizing on the 
  European reference framework, consisting of 20 competences for a democratic culture, 
  considered specific competences of the discipline, conventionally grouped into 
  4 basic components, one of them being Values, which also includes the Valuing democracy, 
  justice, equity, equality and rule of law set. This set of values is based on the 
  general belief that societies must function and be governed by democratic processes 
  that respect the principles of justice, equity, equality and the rule of law. The 
  disciplinary curriculum includes content units (cl. V): All different, all equal 
  with the theme: human similarities and differences, stereotypes and prejudices,

  <p>(iv) Health education: Health promotion and disease prevention, promoting health 
  education is one of the priority objectives of the educational system. The Ministry 
  of Education and Research promotes Health Education through the lens of all school

  units as: Healthy way of life – value emphasis. Health as value. Health and life 
  priorities. Health - element of culture. Ways of manifesting the culture of personal 
  health. Use of the right to disease prevention and health maintenance services.

  include the theme of promoting a healthy way of life. Also, in the structure of 
  the curriculum for the mandatory subject Biology for secondary education, the module 
  "Human organism and health" was developed, through which students are guided to 
  engage in health maintenance activities in order to form a sanogenic behavior. 
  Thus, in grades I-XII, the promotion of a healthy way of life is carried out through 
  the reconceptualized curriculum in the mandatory discipline "Personal Development" 
  (1 hour per week), starting with the 2018-2019 academic year. Health education 
  is also carried out through the subjects: Physical Education (in the environment, 
  30 hours each year), the "Healthy Lifestyle" module, Biology, the newly introduced 
  module in the curriculum, "The Human Organism and Health" (in classes VI-IX), but 
  also through the "Reproductive system and human reproduction" module (in class 
  XI). Taking into account the cyclical nature of the educational process, in curricular 
  and extracurricular activities regarding the healthy way of life, all students 
  from the general primary and secondary education system were included. Within the 
  optional classes, the Breast Education discipline. </p>
