  <p> ***Non-statistical indicator***</p> 
  <p>The Ministry of Justice has developed a new draft law on access to information. 
  The new law is to transpose the international standards in the field, namely, the 
  Troms√∏ Convention, the EU Directive on the reuse of public sector information, 
  the public administration principles of SIGMA, the World Bank standards on the 
  proactive disclosure of public information, etc.</p> 
  <p>The draft law on access to information, developed by the Ministry of Justice, 
  was placed for public consultation on the particip.gov.md platform between 09.01.2023-03.02.2023, 
  being adjusted according to the proposals received. The draft law, which comes 
  to improve the legal framework in the Republic of Moldova regarding access to information, 
  was voted in the first reading during the Parliament session of 11.05.2023. </p> 
  
  <p>A relevant indicator of this indicator is the INDEX OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION: 
  measuring the transparency of public institutions in the Republic of Moldova, a 
  study carried out by Freedom House. In this study, the quality of legislation and 
  the performance of public institutions in ensuring access to information were measured 
  systematically based on a series of criteria and indicators. Through this approach 
  and extensive analysis, the aim was to make an objective and detailed assessment 
  of the situation in the field. The results of the analysis will be reflected in 
  the Index of Access to Information in the Republic of Moldova, which represents 
  an indicator consisting of 3 elements: INDEX OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION LEGISLATIVE 
  FRAMEWORK 1. Correspondence of the legislative framework with international standards, 
  2. The level of proactive transparency, 3. The efficiency of access to information 
  upon request, WHICH TOGETHER CONSTITUTES 100% OF THE SOURCE (https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/2022-11/fh-Moldova_Access-to-Info-Report-2022_Rom-v2.pdf). 
  In 2021, the first report was published that analyzed the degree of transparency 
  of public institutions in the Republic of Moldova.</p> 
  <p>In 2021 the score was 46 out of 100, in 2022 - 47 out of 100. </p>
