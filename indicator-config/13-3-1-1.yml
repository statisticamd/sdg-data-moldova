  <p>Actions regarding the
  effects of climate change integrated into the education curriculum:</p> 
  <p>1)Primary, general secondary - "YES" for the years 2018-2022</p> 
  <p>2) Secondary and post-secondary technical professional - "YES" for the years 2010-2022</p>
  <p>3) Tertiary - "YES" for the years 2010-2022</p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Note:</p>
  <p>1) Education - primary, general secondary: In 2018, the Curriculum Reform
  was started which determined the correlation of curricular policies with national
  and international educational standards and the formatting of the graduate's
  profile through the prism of educational purposes and the key skills system.
  In primary education, grades II-IV, in the Mathematics and Sciences Curriculum
  Area, the mandatory Science discipline is studied, for which the curriculum was
  developed and the document ensures the completion and updating of the contents related
  to natural phenomena, including climate changes. Thus, the curriculum includes
  specific development skills, namely: (1) identifying and describing the components,
  phenomena, processes, relationships characteristic of the environment,
  demonstrating correctness and coherence in the use of specific terminology; (2)
  exploration-investigation of the environment, showing curiosity and interest in
  capitalizing on specific methods and tools for collecting and organizing results;
  (3) explaining the information/results/conclusions obtained in efforts to learn
  about the environment, showing a critical and creative attitude; (4) solving
  some problem situations based on the integration of the acquisitions acquired in
  the discipline with those in other fields, showing interest in the active promotion
  of environmental values and a healthy way of life. In the context, the Science
  discipline in grades II-IV is oriented towards training the student through
  the prism of education towards nature, the environment, knowledge of the flora and
  fauna of the Republic of Moldova, responsibility towards natural biodiversity,
  protection of natural heritage, but also the use of skills in making decisions
  to protect and maintaining natural well-being. For middle and high school education,
  the Geography discipline is studied, which includes content units aimed at
  the topic of the effects of climate change.</p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>2) Secondary and post-secondary professional technical education: In the College of 
  Ecology inChisinau, the following programs are studied: Ecology and environmental 
  protection and Forestry, which include subjects related to the effects of climate change
  (mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning).</p> 
  <p>3) Higher education: In the pedagogical universities
  of the Republic of Moldova, the subjects related to the effects of climate change
  (mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning) are included in
  the programs in the field of Educational Sciences, Geography specialty." </p>
