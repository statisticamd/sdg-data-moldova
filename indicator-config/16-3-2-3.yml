data_footnote: The resulting percentage rather represents the ratio between the number of judgments and decisions issued in respect of the Republic of Moldova and the number of cases notified each year. The results do not necessarily reflect the proportion of cases in which violations of the ECHR have been found. These data refer to the Court's direct activity and its priority areas (either communication of cases or delivery of judgments/judgements), which fluctuate from year to year. At the same time, given the length of proceedings before the Court, applications communicated in a particular year are dealt with in the subsequent years, depending on their subject matter, complexity and priority.
