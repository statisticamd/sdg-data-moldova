  <p>For 2018-2022 years the answer is „YES” for i) sustainable development, ii) 
   education for climate changes and their multidisciplinary approach in school  
  curricula so as to set up the graduate profile.</p> 
  <p>Note:</p> 
  <p>Sustainable development: The framework plan for primary, secondary and high 
  school education offers every student the opportunity to opt for optional subjects. 
  The optional subjects represent the flexible component of the Education Framework 
  Plan that contributes to the development of transversal skills. The priority areas 
  also include Education for Sustainable Development, which is oriented towards the 
  use of competences in the field of ecological education to understand and identify 
  solutions in case of local and global problems, such as those of sustainable development, 
  environment, green economy, energy conservation/ use of alternative energy sources/promotion 
  of energy efficiency measures, etc. The curriculum developed in 2018 for the Science 
  discipline in primary education also highlights the training of students' skills 
  and the interest in actively promoting environmental values and a healthy way of 
  life. The theme of ecological education is studied in educational institutions 
  within the framework of compulsory classes, optional classes and extracurricular 
  activities. The teaching staff orients the students, in school subjects related 
  to the pre-noted field, towards the use of skills in the field of ecological education, 
  for understanding and identifying solutions in the case of local and global problems, 
  as well as those of sustainable development, environment, green economy, conservation 
  energy and promoting energy efficiency measures. For the organization of optional 
  classes, teachers have the Curriculum for the optional discipline "Ecological Education" 
  for grades I-XII and the Curriculum for the optional discipline "Chemistry and 
  environmental exploration" for grades X-XII (approved by the National Curriculum 
  Council and by order ME no. 874 of September 8, 2015).</p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Education for climate change: In 2018, the Curriculum Reform was started, which 
  determined the correlation of curriculum policies with national and international 
  educational standards and the formatting of the graduate's profile through the 
  prism of educational goals and the key skills system. In primary education, grades 
  II-IV, in the Mathematics and Sciences Curriculum Area, the mandatory Science discipline 
  is studied, for which the curriculum was developed and the document ensures the 
  completion and updating of the contents related to natural phenomena, including 
  climate changes. Thus, the curriculum includes specific development skills, namely: 
  (1) identifying and describing the components, phenomena, processes, relationships 
  characteristic of the environment, demonstrating correctness and coherence in the 
  use of specific terminology; (2) exploration-investigation of the environment, 
  showing curiosity and interest in capitalizing on specific methods and tools for 
  collecting and organizing results; (3) explaining the information/results/conclusions 
  obtained in efforts to learn about the environment, showing a critical and creative 
  attitude; (4) solving some problem situations based on the integration of the acquisitions 
  acquired in the discipline with those in other fields, showing interest in the 
  active promotion of environmental values and a healthy way of life. In the context, 
  the Science discipline in grades II-IV is oriented towards training the student 
  through the prism of education towards nature, the environment, knowledge of the 
  flora and fauna of the Republic of Moldova, responsibility towards natural biodiversity, 
  protection of natural heritage, but also the use of skills in making decisions 
  to protect and maintaining natural well-being. For middle and high school education, 
  the Geography discipline is studied, which includes content units aimed at the 
  topic of the effects of climate change. </p>
